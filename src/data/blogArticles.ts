    title: 'The Countdown is On: Smart Contracts, Faster Blocks, Dynamic Fee & Burn Mechanism & XelisHashV3🚀',
    description: 'Our most important update yet: Smart Contracts are nearly here, along with major upgrades to block times, transaction fees, and XelisHash.',
    content: `
As we move into what promises to be the most pivotal moment in the history of XELIS, the community and broader crypto world are about to witness the culmination of over a year of dedicated development. Our major planned hardfork will bring to mainnet everything we have worked tirelessly to build.

Here’s what’s coming:

## 1. Smart Contracts and XVM (Xelis Virtual Machine)

At the heart of this hardfork is the introduction of Xelis Smart Contracts and our revolutionary Xelis Virtual Machine (XVM). Unlike many projects that opt for shortcuts, XVM has been built from the ground up with a focus on programmability, execution speed, and deep optimization.

But XVM is more than just another virtual machine. Our team has developed a new programming language called Silex with a Rust-like syntax, but tailored specifically for the demands of smart contracts. It’s more powerful, more efficient, and designed to unlock possibilities that EVM and Solidity simply can’t match.

For the first time, smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) can be deployed with tokens that have the same level of confidentiality and privacy as the native Xelis Coin itself. Native token creation, dApps, and confidential token transactions will become a reality, setting Xelis apart from every other smart contract platform in the space.

And the best part? Development is complete. Everything needed for smart contracts and the XVM is ready for mainnet. Currently everything is running on testnet and is being utilized for real dApps creation (DEX, Token Launching Tool, Bridge) and final testing

---

## 2. Faster Block Times

From the beginning, Xelis was launched with 15-second block times to avoid unnecessary chain bloat and keep node storage requirements manageable. Unlike projects that prune and sacrifice blockchain history, we’ve remained committed to full transparency and permanent data availability.

This year, we’ve invested significant time in rewriting node logic, adopting RocksDB over Sled for improved performance, and optimizing sync times to make running a full node more efficient. With these advances in place, the time is right to accelerate.

With the upcoming hardfork, block times will speed up 300% — from 15 seconds down to just 5 seconds per block.

This upgrade makes Xelis the fastest privacy-focused Proof-of-Work coin in the world, all while maintaining encryption and confidentiality. The only projects that come close in speed are non-private coins. With this leap, Xelis becomes unmatched in the balance of speed, privacy, and DeFi programmability.

---

## 3. XelisHashV3: Mining for Everyone

From day one, Xelis has championed the vision of egalitarian mining, where CPUs and GPUs can coexist in a balanced, fair mining ecosystem.

Our algorithm has evolved through XelisHash V1 and V2, each iteration improving resistance to specialized hardware like ASICs and FPGAs. Now, with XelisHashV3, we’re closer than ever to realizing true mining harmony across all consumer-grade hardware.

V3 is currently undergoing heavy testing by leading GPU and CPU miner developers. While some refinements remain, the progress is remarkable. The upgrade will reinforce our long-standing resistance to centralization by ASIC or FPGA manufacturers and ensure Xelis mining remains fair, accessible, and community-driven.

When V3 rolls out, expect to see conversations light up across Twitter, YouTube, Discord, and Telegram as miners everywhere embrace this new chapter.

---

## 4. Dynamic Base Fee + Burn Mechanism

The Dynamic Base Fee mechanism will algorithmically adjust transaction costs to maintain network stability, mitigate spam attacks, and provide predictable, low fees for users. To further secure the protocol, 30% of all contract invoking transaction fees will be burned, preventing miners from manipulating the fee market and reinforcing the deflationary pressure on XELIS.

---

## What is a HardFork?

A hardfork is simply an upgrade to a blockchain’s rules that requires everyone to update their software. Think of it like installing the latest version of an app on your phone, if you don’t update, your app won’t work properly with everyone else’s.

In the case of a blockchain, node operators and miners just need to update their software to the new version so the whole network stays in sync and benefits from the improvements.

From our last hardfork, we learned a few important lessons:

- Give plenty of notice so miner developers, pools, node runners, exchanges, and service providers have time to prepare.
- Coordinate upgrades carefully, ensuring everyone is on the same page before activation.
- Set a minimum difficulty adjustment to prevent sudden increases in block speed, which can cause unnecessary orphans and instability.

By taking these steps, we make sure the transition is smooth, secure, and beneficial for the entire Xelis ecosystem.

---

## A Pivotal Moment for Xelis

This hardfork marks more than just an upgrade, it’s a major milestone for XELIS. With the introduction of smart contracts, the XVM, faster block times, dynamic fees with a burn mechanism, and a new era of egalitarian mining, Xelis is poised to deliver the utility it has promised. We’re deeply grateful to our community for the support and dedication over the past year that made this achievement possible.

---

## Alright…Most Importantly…..Wen?

The team’s goal is to bring these features to mainnet before the end of 2025. As always, timelines may shift if additional testing or new feature improvements are required, since network security and stability remain the top priority.

Stay tuned, stay involved, and we will keep building.

    title: 'XELITE PULSE | Xelis Monthly Update - August 2025 🚀',
    description: 'August was a solid month for Xelis. Development accelerated across core infrastructure, major upgrades landed, and big ecosystem updates.',
    content: `
# Introduction  

August was a solid month for Xelis. Development accelerated across core infrastructure, major upgrades landed, and big ecosystem updates.  

Highlights include:  
🔐 Ledger hardware wallet support hitting a major milestone  
⚡ Dynamic transaction fees to fight spam and preserve scalability  
📊 Forge DEX backend and charting system advancing rapidly  
🔒 Next-generation cryptography primitives added to Silex smart contracts  
🎨 Facelifts coming soon for both the Explorer and Genesix wallet  
🌍 Exchange strategy updates, reflecting our long-term values  
👥 Expansion of the core team with four new members  

---

# Xelis Ledger Wallet Support - Community Update 🔐  

Secure storage is critical, and August brought massive progress on Ledger hardware wallet integration.  

Tritonn has developed a working Ledger application with key functionality already live:  
- Xelis-compatible keypair generation and address derivation  
- Full sr25519 transaction signing and cryptographic verification  
- Balance decryption and Pedersen commitment validation  
- Multi-output support for complex transfers and burns  

### Efficiency and Design  
The app is compact at only ~43KB, estimated at ~80KB when complete (smaller than both Monero and Polkadot). It is memory-optimized for Ledger's constrained environment, and all sensitive operations run directly on-device for maximum security.  

### Next Steps  
Support for additional transaction types, polishing the on-device UI, direct integration with the Genesix wallet, and preparation for a security audit and potential Ledger App Catalog submission. This achievement elevates Xelis security to institutional-grade standards, ensuring holders can confidently store assets offline.  

---

# Dynamic Transaction Fees - Fighting Spam at Layer 1 ⚡  
One of Xelis's superpowers is its ability to scale under stress, even during extreme "storm" spam transaction loads. But high-volume spam can quickly bloat the chain.  
To combat this, we introduced Dynamic Transaction Fees.  

### How It Works  
Transaction fees adjust based on average block size compared to the maximum block size. As blocks become fuller, minimum required fees rise automatically. This makes spamming prohibitively expensive and protects the chain.  

### Results So Far  
The system is already reducing spam pressure as intended. The only drawback is ~1ms overhead during block execution and verification, which the team is actively optimizing.  

### Challenges and Next Steps  
Handling nodes with network latency that attempt outdated transactions, and further refining fee calculation and propagation efficiency.  
This system ensures Xelis remains scalable, spam-resistant, and efficient even under the heaviest loads.  

---

# Smart Contracts - Next-Level Cryptography in Silex 🔒  
August unlocked powerful new capabilities for developers building in Silex, our custom smart contract language.  
- **Ristretto Points and Scalars**: Core building blocks for advanced zero-knowledge cryptography  
- **RangeProof Verification**: Prove hidden values are within ranges without revealing them  
- **Transcript Control and Native Signature Verification**: Build fully custom cryptographic flows  

### Why It Matters  
These upgrades enable private DeFi, zk-KYC systems, auctions, mixers, and privacy pools. They support confidential stablecoins and private voting with verifiable results. They streamline zk-bridges and atomic swaps. Unlike the EVM, which struggles with heavy cryptographic math, Xelis runs it natively at Layer 1 speed with no precompiles or middlemen. Silex is becoming a privacy-first cryptography lab at the base layer - the kind of toolkit usually reserved for specialized chains.  

---

# Forge DEX Development Update 📊  
The Forge DEX team has been building fast, with major strides across backend, charting, and smart contract layers.  

### Indexer and Price Feeds  
The indexer now captures events in real time rather than relying on constant polling. Candle charts are live in proof-of-concept with one-minute, five-minute, fifteen-minute, hourly, and daily resolutions. SQL backend pruning ensures scalability, with one-minute data kept for thirty days and then rolled into higher resolutions. Price feeds in USD, BTC, and ratios are already functional.  

### Charting and UI  
TradingView-style charts are built from backend data. Mini "spark line" charts for swaps and a full advanced chart view with history and EMA indicators are in progress.  

### Smart Contracts  
Cleaner contract-to-contract deposit flows are live, along with iteration improvements (entries() support) for fee and distribution logic.  

### Other Progress  
A devnet transaction-blocking bug has been resolved, and fee-handling and indexing logic are being refined.  

### Next Steps  
Finalize the SQL backend rewrite, integrate backend with Forge's front end, and continue optimizing contracts for efficiency and scalability.  

Forge is shaping up to deliver a premium, on-chain trading experience that is fast, private, and fully native to Xelis.

# Silex Studio Project Manager 🛠  
One of the biggest quality-of-life improvements this month came from Codehalo's work on Silex Studio, the next evolution of the Silex Playground (the developers coding playground and studio for the Silex Smart Contract Language).  
Originally, the Playground was useful for quick tests, but as developers began building more serious smart contracts its limitations became clear. Clicking "compile" could erase previous work, and juggling between external editors like IntelliJ or Emacs and the Playground was inefficient.  

The new Project Manager fixes these pain points and takes Silex development to the next level:  
- Create and manage entire projects with multiple files  
- Preserve work across sessions, avoiding lost progress  
- Export projects as zip files for use in advanced IDEs  
- Future-ready for imports once they are fully supported  

As Dalkson put it, *"it's like coding in Notepad vs coding in VSCode."*  

For newcomers experimenting with their first contracts, Silex Studio offers a unified, easy-to-use environment. For experienced developers, it provides the structure and flexibility needed to build and debug real applications efficiently. This upgrade is more than convenience - it's a step toward making Xelis development approachable, powerful, and professional-grade from day one.  

---

# Facelifts Coming: Explorer and Genesix Wallet 🎨  
Alongside technical upgrades, the team has been working on a fresh design refresh. The Explorer will have a cleaner interface with improved data visibility and smoother navigation. The Genesix wallet will receive an upgraded look and feel, bringing a more intuitive and polished user experience that matches the high standards of the Xelis ecosystem.

# Core Team Growth 👥  
For those who may have missed the announcement on Discord from g45, we are pleased to officially welcome four new members to the Xelis core team.  
- Tritonn (Stack Wallet, Cake Wallet, ECDLP and Silex bounties, Ledger)  
- Cyber (Marketing, Blog, Whitepaper, Moderator, Speaker)  
- Dalkson (Smart Contract Coding, Ideas and Extensive Testing)  
- Codehalo (Silex Playground)  

Each of these contributors has already shown tremendous skill, respect, and commitment to the project. Their work has strengthened the ecosystem in meaningful ways, from technical innovation to community outreach. We believe it is important to recognize their dedication and officially welcome them as part of the team. We are always open to the next wave of talented individuals eager to climb and join us in building the future of Xelis.  

---

# Exchanges Update 🌍  
We made important changes this month to strengthen the long-term integrity of XELIS markets.  
- **XT Exchange**: We requested removal due to values misalignment. Their reliance on long-term artificial market-making conflicted with Xelis's cypherpunk, transparency-first principles.  
- **Biconomy Exchange**: Biconomy independently ran a 90% APR promotion for XEL holders. This was their program, not managed by Xelis.  
- **SafeTrade**: We began conversations with SafeTrade to potentially bring market making and arbitrage tools to improve liquidity, especially after TradeOgre's closure left a gap.  

Our focus remains clear: supporting exchanges that reflect fair, organic markets while continuing to build a healthy ecosystem.  

---

# Community and Ecosystem 🌱  
Developers such as Tritonn and RZR are driving critical progress on hardware wallet support. Miners continue to optimize their hardware and miner devs continue to work to optimize XelisHash. The community testnet continues to grow, with builders experimenting with inter-contract calls and cryptographic functions. Engagement across social platforms is solid, showing that Xelis is not just another project but a foundation for the future of confidential, programmable, & scalable blockchains.  

---

# Looking Ahead 🔮  
September will bring further Smart Contract refinements, Ledger programming, Explorer and Genesix improvements, optimizations to the Dynamic Fee system, Forge DEX front-end integration, Explorer and Genesix facelifts, and continued market improvements.  
The vision is becoming reality: a performant, confidential, Layer-1 ecosystem with the tools to rival and surpass existing platforms.  

---

# Wen Smart Contracts? ⏳  
This is the single most common question we hear from the community. The truth is, smart contracts on Xelis are already live and running strong on the testnet. In fact, they could theoretically be moved to mainnet at any time.  

But doing that right now would only be words. Without dApps ready to launch on day one, it would feel hollow and empty. That's why we are waiting until the ecosystem has the essentials: a fully functioning token launching tool and a decentralized exchange - both of which the Forge team is actively developing.  

This approach has another benefit. Building real dApps alongside improving Silex smart contracts helps us quickly identify which features, functions, and fixes are needed in practice, not just in theory.  

So, wen smart contracts? The short answer: soon. Not promises, not hype, but real development and action - exactly the way Xelis has always operated.  

---

# Closing ✨  
August was a solid and hard-working month - one where progress touched almost every layer of the stack: cryptography, contracts, wallets, exchanges, team growth, and community.  

Every milestone proves our commitment to doing things the right way, from scratch, without shortcuts, and always aligned with our values.  

Thank you to our developers, contributors, and community. Together, we WILL set a new standard for privacy, DeFi and usability.  

Stay tuned, stay involved, and we will keep building.

    title: 'Xelis Smart Contracts Take a Giant Leap Forward: Inter-Contract Calls Are Here',
    description: 'One of the biggest and last milestones before Xelis Smart Contracts go live on Mainnet is here: Inter-Contract Calls.',
    content: `
If you’ve been following Xelis’ journey, you know we’re not building “just another” smart contract platform. From day one, our goal has been ambitious:

- No shortcuts.  
- No cloning someone else’s decade-old design or language.  
- No sacrificing performance or security for convenience.  
- Completely on Layer 1  

We’ve built Xelis Smart Contracts from the ground up — not an EVM copy, not a dated bolt-on to an existing chain. Our VM is engineered for 10x the speed of the EVM, richer functionality, more developer flexibility, and our own developed programming language (Silex) that’s more powerful than Solidity, yet clean and developer friendly with a syntax similiar to Rust.

While others take the easy road — either cloning Ethereum’s limitations or conceding defeat on L1 scalability and falling back on roll-ups and other Layer 2 workarounds — Xelis doubles down on doing things right. We believe true scalability, security, and privacy must be baked into Layer 1 itself. Anything else is a compromise we’re not willing to make.

(Looking at you, projects that brag about “innovation” while shipping EVM clones or punting to L2… cough, cough.)

## The Final Big Piece Before Mainnet: Inter-Contract Calls

After months of building and refining, the Inter-Contract Call system — one of the most powerful and complex features of the Xelis Smart Contract ecosystem — is here on testnet in its first working form.

### What is an Inter-Contract Call?

It’s the ability for one smart contract to directly call functions inside another smart contract. This is a foundational capability for complex dApps and modular design patterns — think DeFi protocols that use multiple composable contracts, game economies with multiple modules, or cross-service APIs in a decentralized environment.

But like everything in Xelis, we didn’t just implement it the “standard” way. We designed it for security-first usuability

### Key Design Features

1. **Public vs Entry Functions**  
Entry functions are the “front door” — they run in the scope of the called contract and are meant for wallet/user interaction.  
Public functions are callable by other contracts for internal logic and are still isolated in their own sandboxed storage.  
This separation means contracts can’t just hijack another contract’s state without permission. Developers can expose only the exact functions they want others to call.

2. **Sandboxed Storage**  
When one contract calls another, the storage changes happen in the called contract’s namespace, unless specifically using a planned delegate_invoke mode — which executes the called contract in the caller’s scope. This gives developers precise control over state modification and prevents accidental or malicious cross-contamination.

3. **Permission System**  
This is where Xelis’ approach blows Ethereum out of the water.
On Ethereum, when you approve a contract to spend your tokens, you’re often granting global, permanent permissions — and shady contracts can drain your entire wallet. In Xelis, we’ve designed a granular permission model:

- None — The contract you call can’t invoke any other contracts on your behalf.  
- All — You fully trust the contract to call any others.  
- Whitelist — You approve a list of specific contracts (up to 255) it can call.  

This is similar to XSWD’s (another innovation by Xelis) permission handling and prevents malicious dApp scams where a hijacked contract suddenly drains unrelated balances (typically referred to as “drainer” scams).

4. **Deposits Between Contracts**  
Contracts can now send value (assets) directly to each other as part of a call. The syntax is simple:

\`\`\`silex
module.invoke(chunk_id, [params], { asset: amount });
\`\`\`

This makes atomic, multi-step value transfers between contracts possible without awkward workarounds.

## TL;DR — What’s Left Before Mainnet

We’re down to the final stretch before Xelis Smart Contracts go live on mainnet:

- Finalize & test the permission system.  
- Extensive stress-testing of inter-contract calls and the entire SC engine.  
- Polish Silex developer experience (interface helpers, documentation).  

Once that’s done — we’re there.

Xelis is proving what’s possible when you refuse to take shortcuts and always put community, users, and developers first. We’ve built a smart contract platform from the ground up, optimized for speed, security, and developer freedom — and now, with inter-contract calls working, the most complex piece is in place.

Mainnet is coming. And it’s going to be huge!

We’re closing out a packed two months of development, milestones, and ecosystem momentum. From the release of the XelisForge DEX backend on Testnet to the latest performance upgrades in v1.18.0, June and July have pushed the Xelis blockchain further into the future of confidential and scalable, decentralized finance.

Let’s break it all down 👇

---

## XelisForge: The First Native DEX Enters Testnet

**The biggest headline this month?** The XelisForge Decentralized Exchange (DEX) backend is now live on Testnet — and it marks a historic moment for the Xelis ecosystem.

### What is XelisForge?

XelisForge is the first-ever token launcher & DEX built natively on the Xelis blockchain, designed specifically to handle smart contract-powered trading of native confidential assets/tokens launched on Xelis.

We’re excited to share that the development of XelisForge is moving full steam ahead by the talented @xelisforge team. Powered by Silex, the advanced, Rust-adapted Smart Contract language developed by the Xelis team, XelisForge is designed for performance and flexibility.

**Details at a glance:**

1. Smart contracts run on a custom VM that is 10x faster than EVM  
2. Built specifically for high-throughput Layer 1 execution  
3. No rollups, no sidechains, no indexers, no Layer 2 BS — everything stays natively on Layer 1

XelisForge will allow users to launch their own tokens, join Liquidity Pools, and seamlessly trade native tokens launched on the Xelis network, all of which inherit the same privacy and confidentiality features as $XEL. That means PoW security, and true decentralization, with no compromises.

### Testnet Milestone Achieved

On **July 3rd**, we officially launched the backend of XelisForge on Testnet. This means the smart contracts, matching engine, and trading logic are functioning end-to-end. Testing is ongoing for:

- ✅ Trade creation & order matching  
- ✅ Wallet integration  
- ✅ Liquidity Pools & AMM  
- ✅ Performance and scalability under simulated network load

The frontend interface is also actively being developed with a preview shared with the community on **July 20th**. Once both layers are complete, we’ll invite the community to beta test the full DEX experience. This makes XelisForge not only a powerful proof-of-concept for Silex, but also the first major dApp built entirely on our contract layer — unlocking a whole new category of applications for the future.

## Xelis Node Improvements: Release v1.18.0 is now out!

A lot of work has been put into this new release including new features, stability/performance improvements and bug fixes!

**Highlights:**

- Fast sync has been improved (again) to be much more scalable with the upcoming Smart Contracts  
- Better compatibility with low-end devices: Our goal is to be able to run the FULL node on ANY device (think Raspberry Pi’s), that’s why some parts of the P2P and a new RocksDB backend has been implemented to align with our target  
- Better P2P blocks/transactions propagation: reduced block propagation latency which should result in reduced orphaned / side blocks count (which is also required in case we move to a faster block time on mainnet)  
- Better P2P stability with few internal changes (including the upgraded peerlist for faster new peer finding) — Configurable P2P Proxy in case you want to fully hide your IP Address to your outgoing peers (SOCKS)  
- Configurable max outgoing peers (set to 8 by default, while the maximum total peers stay to 32). You can increase it if wanted but best option is to make your node a public one so other peers can connect to your node and help to decentralize the network even more  
- Metrics are now available on xelis_daemon for those who want to build a Grafana dashboard for monitoring your node(s) and can be improved over time if you have ideas on what else can be tracked  
- XVM (XELIS Virtual Machine) improvements including new stdlib API — XSWD Relayer (WIP) implementation for future support of dApps across different devices through a secure (encrypted) channel  
- ZK Proofs verification optimized for faster TXs verifications — Improved TXs batching verification  
- Other bug fixes/improvements  

This update is not mandatory, but it is recommended to update. Check it out on the XELIS GitHub here:  
https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-blockchain/releases/tag/v1.18.0

**TLDR:** Continuous Improvement for the future of decentralized, confidential/private, Scalable DeFi.

    content: `
The Xelis ecosystem is pushing into one of its most anticipated milestones: a fully operational, DEX for native confidential tokens on Xelis L1. While most blockchains settle for wrapping their assets into fragmented L2s or borrowing legacy DeFi tooling, Xelis is building its own primitive - from scratch, with security & speed to support native confidential tokens.
This update brings bullish proof: adding liquidity, removing liquidity, and executing swaps all now work directly on-chain.

💧 **Liquidity Engine is Live**

Xelis smart contracts can now support full LP flows.

> "First time adding liquidity I added 1 XEL 1 TEST. This created the LP token and sent it to me. Second time I added 10 XEL and 50 TEST - it took 10 of each and refunded my 40 TEST token."

📈 **Real-Time Price Feeds With On-Chain Reserves**

You can now query liquidity pool reserves directly from the contract to calculate token prices off-chain.

✅ get_contract_data Call to Read Reserves

\`\`\`json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "get_contract_data",
  "id": 1,
  "params": {
    "contract": "acac21aea8910727319c7fd03bc4ee3c399288cb2ce53c8643f5b4759e5a7c4c",
    "key": {
      "type": "default", "value": { "type": "opaque", "value": { "type": "Hash", "value": "3934ef68ab9e93bd30a7f6763d9c0aea8e23059a74e516d373b58ba307dcd7b1" } }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

The reserve struct includes the amount of both tokens and the topoheight of the last update. With this, the client can calculate pricing like so:

> Constant product automated market maker (AMM) Formula:  
> price of B in A = Reserve A / Reserve B

\`\`\`text
# for example
# price of xel in usdt = usdt reserve / xel reserve
# 200 / 100 = 2 usdt per xel
\`\`\`

This allows lightweight price charts, off-chain indexing, and real-time rate displays in wallets and dApps.

🎨 **UX Flow & DEX Frontend Design**

Frontend development is underway with a clean MVP and full-stack integration in view.

> "First step on the path toward in-wallet swaps through our platform. Eventually it'll work in other wallets too." - Tritonn

> "The amazing part is that it all just worked well in the first iteration and is ready for UI embedded testing." - Dalkson

---

🧠 **220 Lines of Code vs 495+ in Uniswap V2**

Let this sink in: Xelis' DEX smart contract is just 220 lines of Silex. That's over 50% smaller than the most comparable version of Uniswap V2.

Why? Because Silex and Xelis Smart Contracts were purpose-built for this.  
No bloated boilerplate. No fragile abstractions. Just simple, readable, and secure core logic - one contract that can handle multiple token pairs, thanks to native multi-asset support. It's easier to write, easier to read, and radically easier to audit.

> "The code is probably simple enough that you could understand everything but the math behind it. If I sent you PancakeSwap's code, you'd be lost." - Dalkson

This is what it means to design a chain and language together from the ground up.  
Security through simplicity. Power through architecture.

---

🚀 **Conclusion**

✅ Liquidity logic: complete  
✅ Swapping verified live  
✅ Contract reserve reads working  
✅ Community Devs calling it the "most painless" stack they've worked with  

The Xelis DEX isn't just coming. It's working.  
Not a clone. Not a fork. A native, confidential token, performant DeFi layer built into the heart of Xelis Layer 1.  
More to come soon!

    title: 'Built Different: Why Xelis Isn’t Just “Adding Smart Contracts”',
    description: 'Xelis isn’t retrofitting contracts onto an aging architecture. We’re building a modern, performant, and confidential smart contract platform natively at the protocol level.',
    content: `
In an era where every blockchain project claims to be “bringing smart contracts,” most are either:

- Recycling outdated, restrictive, and slow EVM templates,

- Relying on bloated, generalized VMs ill-suited for modern use cases,

- Or, increasingly, projects are waving the white flag on proper layer 1 integration — pivoting to layer 2 gimmicks that only highlight the fact their base layer can’t scale and can’t compute. Some hype-up raw BPS numbers while quietly admitting they’ll never support real L1 programmability — because their architecture was never built for it.

Hitting the easy button and reaching for Solidity or Rust — but it’s a compromise. Solidity is still stuck in “web3 2018” mode: limited, insecure, and bloated with outdated patterns. Rust, while powerful, is overengineered and clunky for most smart contract use cases. A purpose-built language changes that. One designed to feel familiar, yet strikes the right balance: expressive, secure, and tailored specifically for your chain’s architecture, with minimal boilerplage, cleaner/modern syntax, intuitive abstractions, and no legacy baggage dragging devs down. But…..most projects do not have the expertise to do language architecture from the ground up.

## ❌ The Status Quo:

- Projects bolt on smart contract support after the fact, using cookie-cutter EVM forks with limited language support, slow execution, and poor optimization.

- Others are pushing complex and fragmented L2 solutions that fracture liquidity, reduce trust assumptions, and rely on centralized sequencers or bridges.

- Even Ethereum’s own L2 rollups struggle to reconcile decentralization with usability and speed — sacrificing core layer-1 guarantees in the process.

## ✅ The Xelis Approach: Built From the Ground Up

Xelis isn’t retrofitting contracts onto an aging architecture. We’re building a modern, performant, and confidential smart contract platform natively at the protocol level. Here’s what sets us apart:

- 🔥 Custom Virtual Machine built for speed, precision, and smart optimization — execution performance, variable control, and contract expressiveness far beyond EVM’s capabilities.

- 🧠 Silex is not just another Solidity clone. It’s an elegant, Rust-like language purpose-built for secure, expressive, and high-performance smart contract development.

- 🛠️ Everything runs on Layer 1 — no L2 workarounds, no fragmented trust, no multi-hop bridges.

## What You’ll Get Natively on Xelis Layer 1:

- 🛥️ Confidential Tokens

- 💱 DeFi Protocols

- ⚙️ Advanced dApps

- 📊 Data-layer integrity built into every TX

All of this is verified directly on the main blockchain layer, with scalability and confidentiality by default — not bolted on after launch.

## 🔥 Why It Matters

Other projects are admitting defeat, offloading complexity to rollups or sidechains. Xelis is doing the hard work now — so developers don’t have to later.

> Instead of chasing compatibility, we’re chasing capability.

> Instead of following the EVM, we’re redefining what a smart contract platform can be.

## Xelis Smart Contracts Update: June 2025

Advancing Silex, the VM, and Fair On-Chain Execution

The Xelis smart contract ecosystem continues to evolve at a rapid pace, with major improvements landing across the Virtual Machine, Silex programming language, and tooling stack. June 2025 was a particularly productive month, featuring upgrades that boost developer ergonomics, unlock powerful new contract patterns, and lay the groundwork for advanced on-chain fairness mechanisms.

## 🔧 Core Development Highlights

**1. Improved Type Introspection in the VM**

Developers can now inspect enum structures and parameter types more easily thanks to the new type_json field added to Parameter objects. This feature enhances tooling support and opens the door to richer editor integrations and better developer experience.

“Exactly what I asked for weeks ago… haven’t had this much fun coding in forever.” — codehalo

**2. Native Callback & Closure Support in Silex**

A major leap forward in expressiveness: function pointers and closures are now fully supported in the Silex smart contract language.

Inspired by Rust’s elegant syntax and safety-first design, the new features allow developers to define and pass executable logic within contracts, unlocking use cases such as lazy evaluation, deferred logic, and more:

\`\`\`silex
fn bar(f: fn(u64) -> u64) -> u64 {
    return f(4) / 2
}

entry main() {
    let closure: fn(u64) -> u64 = |v: u64| {
        return v * 5
    };

    return bar(closure)
}
\`\`\`

With closures now supported, Silex positions itself as one of the most ergonomic and powerful smart contract languages available.

**3. Inter-Contract Calls**

Slated for the next VM update, inter-contract calls are being implemented with native support in the virtual machine, allowing multiple contracts to call each other efficiently by sharing the call stack.

This enables complex composability between contracts — essential for DeFi, DAOs, and layered protocol logic — with minimal overhead.

## 🧠 Experimental Features in Discussion

**Delayed Execution for On-Chain MEV Protection**

A new experimental feature under design is Delayed Execution, aimed at mitigating Miner/Validator Extractable Value (MEV) issues such as sandwich attacks.

The concept:Instead of processing DEX swap transactions based on their order in the block, all swap requests are recorded in memory during block execution. Then, at the end of the block, the contract is re-executed to calculate a fair market price based on all TXs.

**🔍 Use Case:**

- Prevents front-running and transaction-order-dependent manipulation

- Ideal for DEXs and protocols needing block-level fairness

This could represent a significant innovation in MEV resistance — if fully realized in the Xelis architecture.

## 🛠️ Tooling & Playground Enhancements

**1. Live Playground Enhancements**

Significant work has been done on the Xelis Playground UI: https://playground.xelis.io

- Enhanced parameter editing interface

- New “apply” and “cancel” buttons for clarity

- CSS and layout refinements

- More obvious entry point selection

- Fixes to ensure compound types like maps and structs are correctly passed from frontend to backend

![Playground Updates](/uploads/blog/playground1.PNG)

**2. UX & Design Contributions**

Developer codehalo contributed new layout and design changes to improve usability across the playground interface. These collaborative UI/UX efforts continue to make Xelis development smoother and more accessible.

## 💬 Dev Collaboration & Community Spirit

Xelis development is deeply community-driven. From Slixe’s lightning-fast feature turnarounds to codehalo’s frontend debugging, and the Xelis Forge Token Launching App & DEX work by Dalkson and Triton, the pace and transparency of development have impressed many in the community:

> “This is what Slixe does — mention a feature and it’s done the next day.”
> “One time I half-joked about a vanity wallet generator… an hour later it was live.”

There’s clear momentum and pride in building a language and stack that developers actually enjoy using.

> “I think this will be the most painless SC language out there, honestly.”

## 🚀 What’s Next

Here’s what’s on the immediate horizon for Xelis smart contracts:

- ✅ Finalize and ship inter-contract call support

- 🛠️ Continue playground polishing and responsiveness fixes

- 🧪 Prototype Delayed Execution logic and MEV protections

- 🔍 Explore advanced closures, lazy evaluation, and improved runtime scheduling

- 🧱 Lay foundations for future innovations like contract versioning and sandboxed simulation environments

    title: 'Redefining Crypto Privacy: How Xelis Brings Confidentiality to the Forefront',
    description: 'Xelis redefines crypto privacy by introducing confidentiality—protecting balances and transactions while maintaining traceability—offering a secure, user-friendly & compliance-friendly alternative to traditional privacy coins.',
    content: `
As cryptocurrency continues to evolve, one essential pillar has been overlooked and often misunderstood — privacy.

Blockchain technology promised a decentralized future, yet the very transparency that powers it can expose users to surveillance, scams, and serious security risks. It’s time to reframe the discussion around privacy — and Xelis is leading the charge.

## Why Privacy Still Matters
Privacy isn’t about secrecy — it’s about freedom, safety, and control. In a digital economy, where every transaction can be traced, users deserve financial autonomy without becoming targets. Unlike traditional finance, where balances and payments are confidential by design, most cryptocurrencies expose transaction data on public ledgers.

This visibility can be exploited — and has been. Users are vulnerable to phishing, extortion, and even real-world threats simply for holding crypto. Yet, calls for privacy are often met with suspicion, painted as harboring criminal intent.

It’s a dangerous misconception. Privacy is not the problem — it’s the lack of nuance in its implementation.

## The Misunderstanding of Privacy Coins
Privacy coins have long battled negative perceptions. While some bad actors abuse anonymity, the overwhelming majority of users seek protection — not concealment. Traditional banks don’t publish your account balance for public viewing — why should your wallet?

Regulators, exchanges, and even users often recoil from privacy coins, fearing de-listings and compliance hurdles. As a result, crypto users are forced into an impossible choice: security or functionality.

This is the gap Xelis fills.

## Xelis: The Rise of Confidential Crypto
Rather than pursuing total anonymity, Xelis redefines privacy as confidentiality.

Here’s what that means:

- Transaction amounts and wallet balances are hidden
- Addresses and transaction flows remain visible for traceability
- Compliance-friendly design with privacy that doesn’t raise red flags

This selective approach creates a hybrid system: one that protects users from bad actors while allowing integrations with regulated platforms. Xelis doesn’t hide everything — it protects what matters.

## A Practical Path to Adoption
Thanks to its balanced architecture, Xelis has already seen interest from exchanges and services that traditionally avoid privacy coins. Its design mirrors the confidentiality of traditional finance while avoiding the blanket opacity that raises compliance concerns.

In an industry often forced into extremes, Xelis proves that privacy can coexist with accountability.

Why Confidentiality Is the Future
As crypto adoption accelerates, so do the risks. Public ledgers have made it easier than ever to track, dox, or exploit users — something no one would tolerate in the legacy financial system. Xelis eliminates these risks without resorting to full anonymity.

Confidentiality isn’t a luxury — it’s a requirement for mass adoption. Xelis offers a future where privacy isn’t suspicious — it’s responsible.

## TL;DR
Xelis isn’t a privacy coin. It’s a confidential coin — blending user protection with transparency. It protects your financial data without triggering red flags, proving that crypto privacy doesn’t have to be all or nothing.

🧪 Take back Confidentiality. Stay Xelis.

    title: 'Xelite Pulse | Episode 26: May Monthly Review',
    description: 'Dive into the Xelite Pulse, our monthly development, marketing, and community update, highlighting the previous months accomplishments.',
    content: `
It's been another productive month for Xelis, with significant progress across several core projects and initiatives. While many of the latest developments may fly under the radar for newcomers, they're laying a strong foundation for major growth in 2025.

## 🛠️ Development Highlights

### 1.) Block Speed Reduction (5 seconds) launched on Testnet  
![5 Second Blocktimes](/uploads/blog/5sec.jpg)
On May 22nd the XELIS Project announced a major upgrade that marks a significant milestone for a privacy-focused blockchain technology. In a bold leap forward, XELIS has reduced its testnet block times from 15 seconds to just 5 seconds, delivering a threefold increase in speed - without altering its core consensus protocol. This improvement to testnet paves the path to block speed reduction on our mainnet as we head towards Smart Contracts becoming live on Mainnet.  

Xelis has once again delivered on its promises - proving that 15-second block times were just the beginning. Our long-term goal has always been to maintain a lightweight, fully immutable ledger. We've been intentional in our approach, choosing not to accelerate block times prematurely. By waiting for real network usage before scaling, we avoid unnecessary bloat from empty blocks and ensure the network remains efficient and sustainable. This stands in contrast to many fast block speed chains that are forced to implement pruning due to excessive blockchain bloat (ie. Kaspa).

### 2.) Xelis Node Database Rewrite to RocksDB from Sled  

This May Xelis completed an overhaul of the blockchain's database layer. The project has transitioned from using Sled, an embedded database engine, to RocksDB, a high-performance key-value store known for its efficiency and low-latency operation. The results are nothing short of impressive:  

💽 Disk Usage: Reduced from 15GB to just 4GB  
🧠 RAM Consumption: Significantly reduced  
✍️ Code Rewritten: Over 10,000 lines of code revamped  
⚡ Syncing: Now faster, lighter, and more stable than ever  

And perhaps most notably, all of these improvements come without changing the blockchain's consensus model, preserving the cryptographic integrity and trustless nature of the network.

🧩 **A Boost for Low-Spec Nodes**  
In a space where many chains require powerful hardware to run nodes or rely on forced ledger pruning to keep nodes viable, XELIS is going in a different direction. This database update further enables full immutable ledgers to be maintained even on low-spec hardware such as Raspberry Pi's, making it far more accessible to run a full node. That means greater decentralization, improved network resilience, and a lower barrier to entry for developers and users alike.

🛠 **Open Source and Transparent**  
As always, XELIS continues to embrace transparency and open-source principles. The full differences of the database transition is available on GitHub: https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-blockchain/pull/115

### 3.) Xelis Genesix Wallet Update 0.0.8  
![Genesix 0.0.8 Update](/uploads/blog/genesix8.png)
Genesix Wallet Version 0.0.8 brings forth probably the most impactful updates since we launched our native desktop and mobile wallet.  

✅ **Full XSWD integration** - a user-managed, device-only permission layer for connecting to dApps and DeFi. (no third-party servers like WalletConnect!) This update is critical for our upcoming smart contracts and DeFi. Want to test XSWD? Dive in on testnet to https://xelisforge.app our token launching tool, and connect your wallet to the forge via XSWD.  

✅ **Built-in address book and enhanced UI**. Now you can save your most frequently interacted with addresses  

✅ **Multi-signature Wallets** - Require multiple approvals for transactions + view-only mode. This allows wallets to be utilized by groups/entities requiring a minimum # of signatures to send funds. It can also strategically be used by single users to further secure their wallet needing two separate seed phrases/wallets to send transactions.  

✅ **Biometric Authentication**- Use Face ID, fingerprint & more for quick, secure access on mobile (android).  

✅ **Confidential Asset Tracking** - Auto-detect & manage soon-to-be launched confidential tokens on Xelis L1  

✅ **UX & Performance Upgrades**: 1.) Tx History Overhaul - Smoothly navigate large lists with filters & lazy loading. 2.) Precomputed Tables - Instant background table generation = zero wait time. 3.) General Fixes - Bug fixes, UI polish, and speed enhancements throughout.

### 4.) Node Stability & Stress Testing  
May was a month of deep testing and critical improvements for the Xelis network. Our core focus was on node stability, stress testing, and validating performance under the new infrastructure updates.  

🔧 Key highlights:  
- Successfully tested the new RocksDB integration, a major upgrade aimed at improving data handling and long-term scalability.  
- Continued testing of 5-second block times on testnet, pushing the network on it's speed performance.  
- Identified and addressed several core issues affecting node syncing, stability, deadlocks and transaction processing throughput.  

To support this, our developers launched "Xelis Storm" - an automated tool that spams the network with thousands of transactions to simulate high-load conditions and expose weaknesses. To date, we have already spammed the testnet with over 2 million transactions in just a couple weeks of our testing period  

These efforts are laying the groundwork for a faster, more robust Xelis mainnet as we move toward smart contract deployment in 2025.

### 5.) Xelis Token DEX (decentralized exchange)  

The community development team, led by Dalkson and Triton, continued progress on the first iteration of a decentralized exchange (DEX) - a key component of the Xelis ecosystem. Similar in concept to platforms like Uniswap or PancakeSwap, this DEX will be essential to have in place prior to the launch of Smart Contracts and XELIS Tokens on mainnet, as day-one trading will play a vital role in the network's early success.  

During this development phase, the team has been focused on building and refining the backend architecture, making significant strides toward completing the core framework that will power the exchange.

### 6.) Another Multi-Asset Wallet Integration  

Following up our success in implementing Xelis in Stack Wallet, a popular-privacy focused multi-asset wallet. The Xelis development team led by Triton is working again on another popular multi-asset wallet implementation that will not only include Xelis, but also our future Xelis Tokens. While the details are still confidential, you can be sure this will be big news for our users & the future Xelis ecosystem!

# 🚀 XELIS Testnet Hits Lightning Speed with 5-Second Blocks After Major DB Rewrite

*Revolutionizing blockchain speed, performance, and accessibility—without compromising privacy or programmability.*

The XELIS Project has just announced a major upgrade that marks a significant milestone for privacy-focused blockchain technology. In a bold leap forward, XELIS has reduced its testnet block times from **15 seconds to just 5 seconds**, delivering a threefold increase in speed—without altering its core consensus protocol.

This speed boost comes thanks to a complete overhaul of the blockchain's database layer. The project has transitioned from using **Sled**, an embedded database engine, to **RocksDB**, a high-performance key-value store known for its efficiency and low-latency operation. The results are nothing short of impressive:

- 💽 **Disk Usage**: Reduced from 15GB to just 4GB  
- 🧠 **RAM Consumption**: Significantly reduced  
- ✍️ **Code Rewritten**: Over 10,000 lines of code revamped  
- ⚡ **Syncing**: Now faster, lighter, and more stable than ever  

And perhaps most notably, all of these improvements come **without changing the blockchain's consensus model**, preserving the cryptographic integrity and trustless nature of the network.

## 🧩 A Boost for Low-Spec Nodes

In a space where many chains require powerful hardware to run nodes or rely on forced ledger pruning to keep nodes viable, XELIS is going in a different direction. This update further allows **full immutable ledgers** to be maintained even on **low-spec hardware** such as Raspberry Pi's, making it far more accessible to run a full node. That means greater decentralization, improved network resilience, and a lower barrier to entry for developers and users alike.

## 🛠 Open Source and Transparent

As always, XELIS continues to embrace transparency and open-source principles. The full differences of the database transition is available on GitHub:  
🔍 [View the commit diff](https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-blockchain/compare/master...rocksdb)

## 🔮 What’s Next?

With this infrastructure upgrade in place, XELIS is positioning itself as the fastest, most scalable, efficient and privacy-respecting blockchain in the world. The new testnet experience not only sets a benchmark in performance but also reinforces the project's long-term commitment to continuous improvement.

With this integration, Xelis holders can now manage their XELIS in the same wallet they use for privacy coins like Monero and major chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum – without sacrificing decentralization or control.

---

## ✅ Why This Integration Matters

With the integration of XELIS into Stack Wallet, users can now:

- 🔐 Securely store and manage XELIS with full control over private keys  
  _(Private keys in Stack Wallet are fully compatible with the Xelis CLI, Genesix GUI, and Web Wallet.)_

- 🌐 Access XELIS alongside major crypto assets in a unified interface
- 📱 Sync across platforms for a consistent and intuitive experience

This significantly enhances the **accessibility of XELIS**, making it easier for privacy-conscious users to use the currency in everyday scenarios.

---

## 🔭 Looking Ahead: XELIS Tokens on the Horizon

As Xelis continues to develop, the team is preparing to launch **Xelis Tokens** – native confidential tokens that will unlock the full potential of the ecosystem.

Once live on mainnet, we aim to collaborate with Stack Wallet again to **bring full token support** to the wallet.

---

## 💬 A Message of Gratitude

A heartfelt **thank you** to the Stack Wallet dev team for making this integration possible. Your openness, professionalism, and dedication to privacy-first technology are appreciated by the entire Xelis community.

Now that you’ve had the opportunity to meet the brilliant minds behind Xelis, it’s time to shift our focus to the heart of the project itself. At Xelis, we’re not just building another cryptocurrency — we’re redefining what decentralized technology can achieve. From our mission to empower individuals with true financial privacy to our innovations in blockchain technology, Xelis is a project designed to challenge the status quo.

In this next segment, we’ll delve deeper into what makes Xelis unique.


## Project Vision and Goals

**What is the core mission of Xelis, and what problems does it aim to solve?**

Xelis aims to redefine what cryptocurrency stands for: decentralized, powered by community, and built for independence.

Our goal is to tackle several challenges within the cryptocurrency space. First, we use an egalitarian Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm that allows for mining with both CPUs and GPUs, enhancing decentralization.

Second, in order for cryptocurrency to be used for daily payments, we need to ensure fast transactions that can compete with credit card networks. We address this by utilizing a BlockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) and several optimizations to achieve speed and scalability.

Finally, confidentiality & privacy is at the heart of Xelis. We believe that individuals should have control over their financial data, ensuring that no one can see your “bank account” balance or track your spending amounts.

All of this is brought together in our user-friendly application, Genesix, which will onboard anyone, regardless of their experience level.

**How do you envision Xelis impacting the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem?**

We aim to educate people on the importance of confidentiality for real-world cryptocurrency usage. Privacy is essential for individuals to have control over their financial information, and Xelis hopes to lead this shift in the broader crypto space.

**What long-term goals do you have for Xelis in the next 5–10 years?**

Our goal is to become one of the fastest and most widely used networks. If we achieve this, we will have successfully provided privacy and scalability to a large number of people, enabling widespread adoption of decentralized finance.


## Development and Technology

**What unique features or innovations does Xelis offer compared to other cryptocurrencies?**

Xelis introduces several unique features:

- BlockDAG in the Account Model: Xelis is the first BlockDAG implementation with an account model, providing scalability and performance.
- Homomorphic Encryption for Privacy: Xelis is the first mainnet BlockDAG to implement privacy through Homomorphic Encryption, ensuring that user transactions amounts and wallet balances are private and secure.
- Integration Tools: We provide SDKs and APIs, making it easier to integrate our chain into other projects.
- Ownership and Balance Proofs: Xelis offers unique proofs, such as Ownership Proofs (to prove ownership of any asset) and Balance Proofs (to securely prove your encrypted balance without revealing your wallet).
- Virtual Machine (XVM): Xelis has a highly customizable Virtual Machine that is fast, secure, and ideal for integrating decentralized applications (dApps) or plugins.

**Can you explain the technology behind Xelis and what sets it apart?**

Xelis uses a BlockDAG structure for fast and scalable transactions. This unique architecture allows us to achieve high throughput without compromising security or decentralization.

One of the key differentiators is the use of Homomorphic Encryption. This technology allows us to process encrypted data without decrypting it, ensuring that sensitive information remains private.

Our XVM and Smart Contract architecture is designed to be highly customizable, offering a safe sandbox for developers to create decentralized applications. The speed and flexibility of the XVM make it an ideal platform for building scalable and secure dApps.

**What challenges have you faced during the development of Xelis, and how did you overcome them?**

The biggest challenge was addressing all the front-running issues that can occur with the use of ZK Proofs in the account model. The account model functions as a value updated with each action, similar to how websites manage their user databases. A front-running issue could arise if Alice sent some coins to Bob, but Bob had already initiated a transaction. Bob’s transaction would then become invalid because Alice’s update to Bob’s balance would make the ZK Proofs completely outdated, resulting in an invalid transaction.

Most cryptocurrencies handle this by maintaining two balances: a locked balance and an unlocked balance. The unlocked balance is only spendable after a set period. However, we didn’t want to implement this because we aimed for instant finality, allowing coins to be spent immediately in the next block after they are received.

To achieve this, we needed to track each version of a balance. Essentially, we created a list of all balances stored by the topoheight of the action that updated the balance. Each balance version consists of two parts:

- The “output” balance: This contains the balance minus the total spent by the user in the block.
- The final balance: This contains the current balance plus all inputs received, minus all outputs spent.

We then introduced a “reference” type in the transaction to correctly select the balance for ZK Proof verification. This ensures that an older balance cannot be used instead of the latest output balance, preventing double spending. The reference is the key innovation that keeps ZK Proofs completely valid, even when other coins are sent or received.

For instance, if we perform three transactions (TXs) simultaneously with the same reference, but one of the three TXs is executed in the next block, it’s fine. The protocol will simply fall back to the latest “output” balance instead of selecting the referenced one. If Alice sends us coins while we’ve already initiated a TX, that’s also fine. The reference topoheight can be lower than the latest balance topoheight available, provided no coins have been spent in that interval.

The protocol uses the referenced balance for verification, while for storage and final balance, it takes the latest available balance. It applies Homomorphic Encryption operations on this balance, ensuring it includes all inputs and outputs, making it fully usable in the next block.

The second biggest challenge was rewriting the BlockDAG execution order. We needed to track all changes occurring within a block to easily “undo” the actions and rewrite them if necessary. To achieve this, we created our own layer for tracking changes by storing DAG-dependent data based on the topoheight. We also developed custom “pointers” to reference the latest value available.

To prevent significant performance loss, we implemented caching to reduce frequent read/write operations on the database. Additionally, we verified the execution order to avoid re-executing everything unnecessarily. Instead, we identified the changes and determined where to start recalculations, using the appropriate topoheight or block hash as the baseline.


## Community Engagement

**How do you plan to engage with the Xelis community, and what role does community feedback play in your development process?**

We place a strong emphasis on community engagement. Our Discord and Telegram is a space where we actively listen to feedback and make adjustments based on suggestions. We recognize that each community member brings valuable skills, knowledge, and perspectives. By considering their feedback, we’re able to improve our project and see things from different angles.

**What advice would you give to new users or investors looking to get involved with Xelis?**

We encourage new users and investors to join our social media channels and actively participate in the community. If you have questions, ask them openly; either we or another community member will provide an answer. Everyone is welcome, and your participation helps us improve. The strength of our community lies in its numbers and engagement.

**How can the community contribute to the growth and success of Xelis?**

Community members can contribute by spreading the word about Xelis, providing feedback on our tools, and engaging with the project on social media and our community chats. Every bit of involvement helps strengthen the network and its ecosystem. We also routinely have bounties/paid opportunities to assist in the development of Xelis. In addition, all of Xelis is open source, so all may contribute freely on GitHub.


## Team Dynamics

**What do you value most in your team, and how do you foster a positive work environment?**

The most important thing I value in my team is the open exchange of ideas. Everyone is encouraged to share their thoughts, feedback, and suggestions. We avoid pressuring anyone and allow each team member to work at their own pace. This fosters a positive, collaborative environment where creativity can thrive.

**How do you handle differences in opinions within the team during the development process?**

Differences in opinion are rare because each team member is responsible for their own part of the project. We trust each other to make the right decisions. However, when disagreements do arise, we discuss the issue, understand each other’s points of view, and either vote on the best solution or defer to someone’s experience with a similar problem.


## Future Outlook

**What upcoming features or developments are you most excited about?**

The upcoming implementation of Smart Contracts on our testnet is a major milestone. We’re excited to push this forward and gather more feedback and testing from the community. Smart Contracts will unlock new possibilities for developers and users, enhancing the overall functionality of the Xelis network.

    title: 'Xelite Pulse | Privacy and Confidentiality in Cryptocurrency: Restoring Balance with Xelis (Episode 13)',
    description: 'Xelis takes a measured approach to privacy, redefining it as confidentiality. While traditional privacy coins aim for complete anonymity, Xelis provides selective confidentiality.',
    content: `
# The Role of Privacy in Cryptocurrency: The Xelis Perspective

The evolution of cryptocurrency has been a transformative journey, reshaping our understanding of finance and decentralization. However, one key principle — **privacy** — has faced significant challenges and, at times, outright neglect. This article explores the critical role of privacy in cryptocurrency, why it has been misunderstood, and how **Xelis** provides a balanced solution by prioritizing confidentiality while addressing the concerns tied to full anonymity.

## The Importance of Privacy in Cryptocurrency

Privacy is a cornerstone of freedom in any society. It:

- Safeguards individuals from undue surveillance
- Protects financial autonomy
- Ensures sensitive information does not fall into the wrong hands

In cryptocurrency, privacy is even more crucial. Blockchain transparency can unintentionally expose users’ financial data. Without sufficient privacy:

- Users are vulnerable to phishing attacks
- Risk of scams increases
- Threats of physical harm can arise

Despite these risks, privacy in crypto has often been misunderstood and unfairly stigmatized.

## Misconceptions About Privacy Projects

Privacy coins are often wrongly associated with criminal activity. Key points:

- **Misunderstanding of privacy**: Most users seek protection, not concealment.
- **Unfair comparisons**: Traditional financial systems don’t expose transaction data publicly.
- **Regulatory impact**: Delistings and reduced adoption due to perceived risks

This misunderstanding has created a demand for privacy tools that strike a balance between confidentiality and transparency.

## Xelis: Striking the Right Balance with Confidentiality

Xelis redefines privacy as **confidentiality**, aiming for selective, not absolute, anonymity.

- Avoids the stigma of full privacy coins

## Adoption and Real-World Implications

Xelis has gained traction among third-party platforms, including exchanges, thanks to its balanced model.

- Avoids the pitfalls of fully anonymous systems
- Aligns more closely with how confidentiality works in traditional finance

It protects users from:

- Phishing
- Identity theft
- Physical targeting

...by hiding only what needs to be hidden.

## Why Confidentiality Matters More Than Ever

As crypto matures, **confidentiality** will become increasingly important. Xelis proves:

- Privacy and compliance can coexist
- Confidentiality is not criminal — it’s essential
- Selective privacy ensures both security and accountability

## Conclusion

Privacy in cryptocurrency is not just a feature — it’s a **necessity**. Xelis offers a thoughtful approach:

- **Safeguards transaction data and balances**

    title: 'Xelite Pulse | Balancing Privacy, Scalability, and Speed: The Trade-offs (Episode 14)',
    description: 'Xelis redefines blockchain scalability by integrating lightweight, efficient privacy mechanisms like homomorphic encryption and zkProofs directly into its blockDAG architecture, avoiding traditional privacy chain performance trade-offs.',
    content: `
## 🔐 Privacy vs. Scalability in Blockchain & BlockDAGs

Technologies like **Homomorphic Encryption** and **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkProofs)** offer strong privacy and confidentiality, but they introduce **computational overhead**. This added complexity affects the **scalability** of both Blockchains and BlockDAGs by slowing down transaction processing.

---

## 🚧 Why These Technologies Make Transactions Slower

### 1. 🧮 Homomorphic Encryption

Homomorphic encryption enables computation on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it. While powerful, it comes with major trade-offs:

- **High Computational Overhead**  
  Operations on encrypted data require significantly more resources than plaintext. For example, a simple addition or multiplication might take multiple encrypted rounds.

- **Complex Cryptographic Algorithms**  
  It depends on advanced, slow-to-execute mathematical structures.

- **Large Data Sizes**  
  Encrypted data includes many extra parameters, leading to higher **communication** and **storage costs**.  
  For example, in Xelis, one ciphertext requires:

  - \`32 bytes\` for the **commitment**  
  - \`32 bytes\` for the **receiver’s handle** (to decrypt the amount)  
  - \`32 bytes\` for the **sender’s handle** (same purpose)  

  > These extra components increase transaction verification time and network propagation delays.

---

### 2. 🧾 Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkProofs)

zkProofs allow one party to prove a statement is true **without revealing the actual data**. However, they come with scalability limitations:

- **Proof Generation Time**  
  Requires intensive operations (e.g. elliptic curve math, polynomial commitments).

- **Proof Verification**  
  More demanding than verifying a simple digital signature.

- **Larger Transaction Payloads**  
  zkProofs must be included in each transaction, inflating their size.

  For instance, Xelis includes:

  - **Ciphertext validity proof** — Ensures the receiver’s ciphertext is valid and wallet-safe.  
  - **Commitment equality proof** — Verifies output commitments match all ciphertexts.

---

## ⚙️ Impact on BlockDAG Scalability

BlockDAGs are built for **parallel processing** and higher throughput. However, privacy methods create challenges:

- **Concurrency Bottlenecks**  
  Cryptographic overhead limits nodes' ability to process transactions in parallel.

- **Increased Latency**  
  Time spent generating/verifying proofs slows transaction confirmation.

- **Higher Resource Requirements**  
  Nodes must handle concurrent, heavy cryptographic workloads—especially challenging for those with limited resources.

---

## 🔄 Traditional vs. Privacy-Enhanced Chains

**Traditional Public Blockchains & BlockDAGs**:

- Use **digital signatures**—lightweight and fast to verify.
- Transactions are processed in **plaintext**—easy to propagate and validate.
- Offer **speed and simplicity**, but at the cost of **user privacy**.

**Privacy-Enhanced Chains (e.g., Xelis)**:

- Include cryptographic layers for **privacy and confidentiality**.
- Must overcome **computational** and **storage challenges**.

## 🧠 What Does This Mean?

While privacy-preserving technologies offer robust protections, they **consume significant resources**. In a BlockDAG setting, this may:

- **Slow down** transaction processing  
- **Hinder** scalability  
- Force developers to choose between **privacy** and **performance**

This trade-off highlights the need to rethink the **blockchain trilemma**. For privacy-integrated systems, it evolves into a **Quadlemma**:

> **Security • Decentralization • Scalability • Privacy**

---

## 🚀 The Xelis Approach: Privacy Without Sacrificing Scalability

Xelis is designed **from the ground up** to balance **privacy** and **scalability**, avoiding the pitfalls of retrofitted privacy layers.

### 🔧 Key Innovations:

- **Lightweight cryptographic methods** — Built-in privacy with minimal overhead  
- **Optimized proof generation & verification** — Faster cryptographic processes  
- **Minimized transaction sizes** — Reduces load on the network  
- **Batch verification** —  
  Xelis verifies **all transactions at once**, drastically improving scalability:  
  > The **more transactions per batch**, the **less time per transaction**.

- **Concurrency-first architecture** — Efficient parallel processing even with privacy features

---

## ✅ Final Thoughts

Xelis breaks the traditional trade-off by offering **scalable privacy** within a BlockDAG architecture. It paves the way for networks that **don’t compromise confidentiality for speed**.

> 🌐 Xelis proves that privacy and performance can go hand in hand.

    title: 'The Case for Confidential Cryptocurrencies: Why I’m Walking Away from Public Chains',
    description: 'Opinion Article: After years of investment, observation, and reflection, I have decided that I will never own another public blockchain project. My focus will instead be exclusively on privacy and confidential blockchain projects.',

## Why I Will Never Own Another Public Blockchain Project  
**By Cyber Henry**

The advent of blockchain technology brought with it promises of **decentralization**, **transparency**, and **empowerment**. Yet, as the ecosystem has evolved, the cracks in the public blockchain model have become glaringly obvious.  

After years of investment, observation, and reflection, I have decided that I will **never own another public blockchain project**.  
My focus will instead be **exclusively on privacy and confidential blockchain projects**. Here’s why:

---

### 🔍 Transparency Without Privacy Is a Double-Edged Sword

Public blockchains like **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum** pride themselves on transparency — every transaction is publicly recorded and accessible.  

While initially hailed as revolutionary, this level of transparency has become a **vulnerability**:

- Imagine your bank balance and every financial transaction you've ever made displayed on a billboard.
- Public blockchain explorers allow **anyone** — competitors, regulators, or malicious actors — to track funds and analyze financial behavior.
- This exposure has led to **real-world targeting** of individuals due to their visible crypto holdings.

> **Confidentiality is not just a preference — it’s a necessity for personal and financial security.**

---

### ⚖️ External Pressures Compromise Public Blockchains

Public blockchains are increasingly shaped by **regulatory pressures**, often at the expense of user autonomy:

- Regulatory demands may push networks to **sacrifice privacy for compliance**.
- Privacy-focused chains are **designed to resist** such pressures and ensure that **users retain control** over their data and actions.

> Privacy is a **resistance mechanism** to external coercion, preserving user sovereignty in a world of increasing surveillance.

---

### 🛡️ Privacy Is the Cornerstone of Freedom

Without privacy, **financial freedom is meaningless**. Public blockchains could:

- Enable dystopian-level surveillance by governments and corporations.
- Suppress dissent and innovation through constant financial tracking.

Projects like **Xelis**, **Monero**, **Zano**, and **Zcash**:

- Prioritize confidentiality.
- Recognize privacy as a **fundamental human right**, not a tool for illicit use.
- Give individuals **control over their financial data**.

---

### 🏢 Businesses Need Confidentiality

For enterprises, public blockchains pose even greater risks:

- Exposure of **supply chains**, **transaction volumes**, and **client relationships**.
- Breaches of **confidentiality agreements** and **competitive strategies**.

Privacy-focused platforms offer:

- **Confidential smart contracts** that protect sensitive operations.
- Enterprise-ready privacy solutions necessary for **corporate adoption**.

---

### 🧭 The Ethical Implications of Privacy

Supporting privacy projects is an **ethical stance**, not just a technical or financial choice:

- In a world where **data = commodity**, privacy is a stand against **exploitation**.
- Public blockchains often **enable mass surveillance** unintentionally.
- Privacy projects **defend individual sovereignty** over their data.

They also empower:

- **Activists**
- **Journalists**
- **Citizens in oppressive regimes**

> Privacy protects the vulnerable — it's a tool for **justice and equity**, not secrecy.

---

### 🧠 Governments and the Myth of “Nothing to Hide”

Governments often push the narrative that "**only those with something to hide need privacy**." This is:

- **Flawed logic** — people lock doors not to hide wrongdoing but to stay safe.
- A tactic to stigmatize privacy and **discourage resistance** to surveillance.

Privacy is:

- About **autonomy**, **dignity**, and **security**.
- A **universal need** in the face of data breaches, identity theft, and overreach.

> Privacy-focused blockchains reclaim this narrative and reaffirm that **privacy is freedom** — not guilt.

---

### 🚀 The Road Ahead

The future of blockchain lies in **privacy and confidentiality**.  

- Public blockchains were a critical **stepping stone**, but they’ve **failed to meet** the fundamental need for privacy.
- Privacy-first projects are building the infrastructure for a **secure, equitable digital economy**.

**As investors, we vote with our capital.**  
By supporting privacy-driven projects, we declare:

> "Transparency without confidentiality is unacceptable."

---

### 🏁 Final Thoughts

In the end, **privacy is about trust** — the trust that your digital life is your own:

- It’s about giving individuals and businesses the **freedom to operate without fear**.
- That’s why I will **never own another public blockchain project**, and will only consider investing in **privacy and confidential blockchain solutions**.

    title: 'XELIS Hardfork/Network Upgrade 1.16.0 Post-Mortem Review',
    description: 'A deepdive into the recent hardfork/network upgrade 1.16.0 including post-mortem review.',
    content: `
## 🔄 Hard Fork Upgrade: Xelis v1.16.0

On **December 30, 2024**, the Xelis network underwent a significant upgrade requiring a **hard fork** to version 1.16.0. This release introduced major improvements across **security**, **scalability**, and **usability**.

The hard fork was driven by:
- A critical bug identified through our bug bounty program 🪲
- Planned performance optimizations ⚙️
- The introduction of new features 🚀

---

### 🛠️ Key Enhancements in Version 1.16.0

**1. zK Proof Improvement (Bug Bounty Identified)**
- Improved verification to ensure source commitment handles are built correctly (as done for receivers).
- Prevents account bricking and other potential exploits.

**2. ZK Proof Transcript Enhancements**
- Included source ciphertext in the transcript for better linkage to balance version.
- Enhanced Commitment Equality Proof by verifying randomness alignment with the sender’s public key.

**3. Fast Sync P2P Protocol Rework**
- Fixed issue where fast-synced nodes could get stuck during mining due to invalidated transactions.

**4. Multisig Wallet Support**
- Added support for **multi-signature wallets**, improving fund security for users and exchanges.
- Crucial for institutional adoption.

**5. Storage Serialization Order Rework**
- Streamlined storage code by introducing a **generic serialization method**.
- Reduces redundancy and improves maintainability.

**6. RPC API Changes**
- Improved developer experience with refinements and new functionality in the RPC interface.

**7. Updated P2P Key Exchange**
- Each daemon now generates a unique Diffie-Hellman (DH) keypair to prevent node fingerprinting.
- Encrypted peer communications using DH-derived shared secrets.
- Options added for handling mismatched peer keys: ignore, reject, or warn.

**8. Commit Point on Chain Sync**
- Introduced a **commit point mechanism** for safe chain reorganizations.
- Helps preserve the original chain during failed reorg attempts.

**9. Smart Contracts Testnet Release**
- Released first testnet version of **Xelis Smart Contracts** using XELIS-VM and **Silex language**.
- Enables decentralized app experimentation and deployment.

**10. Storage Optimization Fixes**
- Optimized storage conflict resolution for better performance on long chains.

**11. New Block Version Implementation**
- Updated transaction selection rules to avoid duplicate inclusion in the same DAG branch.
- Prevents potential chain split vulnerabilities.

**12. Balance and Ownership Proofs**
- Added new cryptographic proofs:
  - Users can prove balances or coin ownership without exposing private keys.
- Future auditing will allow for direct verification in the blockchain explorer.

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced During Hard Fork

**Issue:**  
Mining pools and user nodes remained on the old chain, causing **temporary chain splits**.

**Resolution:**  
- Core team worked with mining pools to ensure all were properly synced.
- Fork was **successfully restarted within one hour**.
- Improved the chain rewind process to be **scalable and chain-size agnostic**.

**Root Cause:**  
- Hard fork worked flawlessly in local and private testnets.
- Mainnet had higher difficulty, leading to simultaneous block creation.
- Resulted in node freezes due to repeated reorg proposals.

**Additional Issues:**
- Miscommunication and short notice before upgrade.
- Timing during holiday season led to reduced operator availability.
- Lack of collaboration with mining pools prior to deployment.

---

### 🔧 Future Improvements

- **Advanced Notice** for mandatory network upgrades with set upgrade dates.
- **Extended Testing** across third-party environments.
- **Fixed Difficulty** introduced for future hard fork transitions.

---

### 💸 Goodwill Compensation

To support affected miners and pools:
- **Financial compensation** was issued from the **development fund**.
- This rare act underlines Xelis’ **commitment to a user-first and miner-friendly approach**.

---

### 📚 Lessons Learned

**1. Comprehensive Pre-Deployment Testing**
- Expand test coverage to include external stakeholders, not just internal teams.

**2. Enhanced Communication with Stakeholders**
- Provide extended upgrade windows.
- Better notify miners, exchanges, and node operators in advance.

---

### ✅ Conclusion

Despite challenges, the hard fork was quickly stabilized:
- **No long-term user impact**
- Thorough post-mortem showed **no exploitation** of bugs before patching

---

### 🔮 Future Plans & Upcoming Updates

Looking ahead, the team is focused on:

- ✅ Smart Contract **Mainnet Launch**
- ✅ **Consensus Algorithm Optimization**
- ✅ Strengthening the **Bug Bounty Program**
  - Now includes formal **Third-Party Audits**

---

    title: 'Xelite Pulse: How to Scale a Private/Confidential Blockchain? (Episode 22)',
    description: 'Dive into why Confidential Blockchains are more difficult to scale than Public Blockchains',
    content: `
When looking to scale a blockchain, one must consider whether the chain is **public or private**, as each type requires different optimizations. While both public and private chains aim to improve **transaction throughput** and **finality**, **privacy-focused chains** face unique challenges due to the computational complexity of cryptographic techniques such as **homomorphic encryption** and **zero-knowledge proofs (zkProofs)**.

---

## Public Blockchains

Public chains typically prioritize:

- **High transaction throughput**
- **Fast finality**

Many chains achieve this by increasing **blocks per second (BPS)**. Higher BPS leads to increased **transactions per second (TPS)**, which reduces congestion and ensures quicker confirmations for users.

---

## Privacy Chains (e.g., XELIS)

Privacy chains must:

- Prioritize **security and privacy**
- Simultaneously work toward **TPS improvements**

The primary challenge is **not block speed**, but the **computational overhead** of verifying **encrypted transactions**. Unlike public chains, where block speed is the main concern, privacy chains focus on optimizing **transaction verification time**.

---

## Key Challenges in Scaling Privacy Blockchains

### Homomorphic Encryption Impact

- **High Computational Overhead**  
  Processing encrypted transactions requires many arithmetic operations, significantly increasing processing time compared to plaintext transactions.

- **Complex Cryptographic Algorithms**  
  Advanced techniques introduce substantial computational costs, slowing down transaction validation.

- **Increased Data Size**  
  Encrypted transactions need extra data to ensure integrity and confidentiality. For example, in XELIS:

  1. 32 bytes for the **commitment**
  2. 32 bytes for the **receiver’s handle**
  3. 32 bytes for the **sender’s handle**

  These requirements increase both storage and transmission costs, slowing down the network.

---

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkProofs) Impact

- **Proof Generation Time**  
  zkProofs involve elliptic curve computations and polynomial commitments, making them slower to generate than traditional digital signatures.

- **Proof Verification Overhead**  
  zkProofs consume more computational resources to validate compared to standard transactions.

- **Larger Transaction Payloads**  
  zkProofs add extra data, increasing:

  - Processing time
  - Transmission load
  - Storage burden

  In XELIS, this includes:

  - **Ciphertext validity proof** – ensures encrypted transactions are correctly formed.
  - **Commitment equality proof** – verifies transaction outputs match their commitments.

---

## Solutions in XELIS for Scaling Privacy Chains

- **Parallel Processing**  
  Enables nodes to process multiple cryptographic proofs at once, reducing bottlenecks.

- **BlockDAG Architecture**  
  Allows concurrent block processing and inclusion in consensus without orphaning blocks.

---

## Conclusion

Scaling public blockchains focuses on increasing **TPS** and reducing **finality time** without compromising security. However, **privacy blockchains** must balance **confidentiality** with **performance**, ensuring cryptographic operations can run efficiently for scalable systems.

It's no longer just about faster blocks or tweaking the consensus mechanism.

**XELIS** achieves this balance by combining:

- Unique **parallel processing** for transaction validation
- A powerful **BlockDAG** structure

> During local testing at 15s block speeds, XELIS can process roughly **~2500 transactions per second**.

However, that is not the end of the story. Xelis is currently developing a multi-thread verification system to further improve TPS.

- **Current Stats:**  
  Xelis achieves around **2500 TPS** with single-threaded transaction execution. However, we're implementing a multi-threaded batching architecture to allow parallel transaction validation, significantly improving scalability.

  - **Early Results:**
    - 4 threads processing transactions in parallel.
    - 10,000 TXs verified in just **1.3084s**.
    - A **3x improvement** in throughput, reaching **7692 TPS** without increasing block size or block time.

**Keep a close eye on our social media and GitHub as we continue to develop this innovative solution to further the processing potential.**

#### 3. **Educational Content Creation**

[Medium Article: **Scaling Public vs. Privacy Blockchains: How Xelis Sets a New Standard**](https://xeliscommunity.org/xelite-pulse-how-to-scale-a-private-confidential-blockchain-episode-22-aaa0efe557fd)

Scaling a blockchain isn’t one-size-fits-all — public and privacy-focused chains require different optimizations. While public blockchains focus on increasing TPS (transactions per second) and reducing finality time, privacy blockchains face additional cryptographic challenges.

Public chains improve scalability by increasing blocks per second (BPS), ensuring faster confirmations and lower congestion. However, privacy chains like Xelis must balance security and TPS, with the real bottleneck being transaction verification time due to:

Homomorphic encryption — High computational overhead and complex cryptography.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkProofs) — Increased proof generation time and larger transaction sizes.
Xelis addresses these challenges with:

Parallel Processing — Nodes validate multiple cryptographic proofs simultaneously, reducing bottlenecks.
BlockDAG Architecture — Multiple blocks process in parallel, preventing orphan blocks and increasing efficiency.
During tests, Xelis achieved approximately 2500 TPS at 15s block speeds, making it the most high-performance proof-of-work privacy chain to date.

Scaling public blockchains is mainly about increasing TPS and reducing finality time, but privacy blockchains require unique solutions. Xelis sets a new standard for confidential transactions by leveraging parallel processing and BlockDAG for both privacy and performance.

Advantages Over Smart Contract Tokens:
Traditional blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain rely on smart contracts, which bring:

Increased attack surfaces and security risks.
Potential centralization and governance vulnerabilities.
Lack of privacy by default, exposing transaction details on the public ledger.
In contrast, Xelis Confidential Assets are secure at the consensus level, offering true privacy, censorship resistance, and enhanced decentralization.

**Easy Token Creation with Xelis:**
Creating confidential tokens on Xelis is made simple:

**One-Click Web-Based & Wallet Deployment:** Available soon, these tools will allow anyone to create and deploy tokens with minimal effort, no technical expertise required.
Advanced Deployment with Silex: For developers looking for more customization, Xelis provides a Rust-adapted scripting language for advanced token creation and deployment.

**Summary of Xelis Confidential Assets Benefits:**
Enhanced Privacy: Built-in transaction confidentiality protects both users’ and developers’ financial data.
Decentralized & Secure: Tokens operate natively on Xelis’s Layer 1 infrastructure, ensuring high security and decentralization.
Versatile Use Cases: Perfect for DeFi projects, meme coins, or privacy-focused utility tokens.
With the Smart Contract Testnet nearing completion, we are excited to move to Mainnet and launch these powerful tools. Stay tuned for the ability to create your own Confidential Assets soon!

# Xelis Unveils New Website: Bridging Crypto Innovation with Real-World Applications

[Xelis](https://www.xelis.org) has officially launched its redesigned website at [www.xelis.org](https://www.xelis.org), marking a significant milestone in the project’s evolution. The new digital presence reflects Xelis’s strategic shift toward making blockchain technology more accessible to businesses and everyday users beyond the crypto-savvy community.

---

## Expanding Beyond Crypto Enthusiasts

As blockchain technology continues to mature, Xelis recognized the need to broaden its appeal and demonstrate real-world utility. The project has deliberately pivoted from focusing exclusively on technical crypto audiences to engaging with businesses and individuals who may not have specialized knowledge but could benefit from blockchain solutions.

> “We’re entering a new phase where blockchain needs to solve tangible problems for regular users, not just appeal to crypto enthusiasts,”  
> — *Cyber Henry, Developer/Designer of the new website & Xelis Head of Marketing & Business Development*

---

## Simplified Messaging for Broader Understanding

The new website features streamlined messaging that communicates Xelis’s core value propositions without overwhelming visitors with technical jargon. Key features and benefits are presented in clear, concise language that highlights practical applications rather than complex technical specifications.

**Visitors to the site will find:**

- Straightforward explanations of how Xelis’s technology can address real-world challenges  
- Clear pathways for users, businesses & developers to explore integration options  
- Accessible resources for newcomers to understand the fundamentals  

---

## Modern Aesthetic Reflects Forward-Thinking Approach

The visual redesign embraces a clean, bright aesthetic that conveys innovation and accessibility. Moving away from the darker themes often associated with cryptocurrency projects, Xelis has opted for a design language that feels more aligned with mainstream technology companies.

The minimalist interface prioritizes user experience, with intuitive navigation and a responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices. This approach reflects Xelis’s commitment to removing barriers to entry and making their technology more approachable.

---

## Bridging Two Worlds

While expanding its reach to non-crypto audiences, Xelis maintains its commitment to the technical excellence and innovation that has defined the project since its inception. The website still provides access to:

- Detailed technical documentation  
- Development resources  
- Community engagement opportunities  

This balanced approach positions Xelis uniquely in the blockchain space — sophisticated enough for developers and blockchain enthusiasts while remaining accessible to businesses and individuals looking to explore the practical benefits of the technology.

---

The launch of [www.xelis.org](https://www.xelis.org) represents more than just a new website; it signals Xelis’s vision for the future of blockchain:

    title: 'Xelis Emissions Schedule',
    description: 'Xelis is a PoW project with a unique emissions schedule. Learn how Xelis rewards miners with its decreasing block rewards.',
    content: `
Xelis $XEL is a privacy, speed & scalability focused Layer 1 BlockDAG project. The Xelis network is secured through Proof-of-Work (POW) where miners utilize hardware to compete to provide “consensus”. Providing consensus ensures that the blockDAG is ordered correctly and only contains the honest transactions. For providing this service, miners are rewarded with Block Rewards of XELIS coins. It’s these block rewards which emit the total supply of Xelis on a daily basis (every 15 seconds to be exact).

In order to understand the supply of POW coins it becomes important to understand the block reward structure and what amount of reward will be paid to miners throughout a project’s lifecycle. Xelis has implemented a smooth emissions reduction strategy which forgoes any halving or sudden decreases in mining rewards. Instead, each block is incrementally decreased by just a fraction leading to a smooth reduction in the block-reward until the max supply of 18.4m is reached. Although very different from the methodology of BTCs halvings, the release follows a similar slope, duration and trend to BTCs emissions.

It is believed that this smooth emissions reduction prevents any unintended consequences of halvings, such as mining hashrate decreasing suddenly due to profitability, thus leading to an insecure network.

For more details on the exact emissions please consult our stats page at: https://stats.xelis.io/views/supply_emission

# Xelis Testnet Update: xelis-hash-v2 and Upcoming Hard Fork

Xelis has launched its new **blockDAG** on testnet, marked by the release of \`xelis-hash-v2\`, which represents a significant step towards enhancing blockDAG security and addressing various bugs. The new blockDAG is undergoing rigorous testing and feedback gathering before an anticipated hard fork on the mainnet.

On the testnet, the chain has been reset for a fresh start, inviting developers and miners to test and provide feedback on the new source code available in Rust and C at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-hash). Interested parties should pull from the \`dev\` branch for testing.

Xelis plans to execute a real hard fork on the mainnet after confirming positive results from the testnet and providing the community ample preparation time. This phased approach underscores Xelis’ commitment to **security**, **innovation**, and **community engagement**.

---

## Key Improvements in the Testnet Release:

- **Increased Extra Data per Transaction:** Expanded to \`32 KB\` per transaction with a \`1 KB\` limit per transfer. This resolves pool and exchange issues when handling high transaction volumes, improving scalability and reducing the risk of orphaned or cancelled transactions.

- **Smooth Difficulty Adjustment:** Stabilizes mining difficulty transitions, ensuring predictable and secure blockchain operations.

- **Bug Fixes:** Includes fixes for wrong difficulty/net hash reporting on explorers and mining stats resources, improving stability and reliability.

- **New Algorithm (\`xelis-hash-v2\`):** Designed to optimize mining performance with a CPU/GPU gap of 2–4x, enhancing resistance to FPGA and ASIC miners.

### Algorithm Improvements:

- Stage 1 simplified and replaced with **Chacha8**, expanding scratchpad size from \`250KB\` to \`440KB\` for efficiency and security.
- Introduced **Blake3** hashing of input chunks to further enhance security against input attacks and expedite verification.
- Stage 2 removed entirely, streamlining the mining process.
- Stage 3 made fully sequential, emphasizing memory-bound operations for performance and integrity.
- New Stage 4 added: hashes the entire scratchpad using **Blake3** to protect against malicious attempts to bypass computations.

These updates reflect Xelis’ dedication to refining its mining algorithm for efficiency, security, and decentralization.

---

## Why is the Mining Algorithm Changing?

Xelis aims to promote **egalitarian mining** supporting both CPUs and GPUs. This strategy enhances decentralization and resists the centralizing effects of ASICs and FPGAs.

### Key Benefits:

- **Decentralization of Hashrate:** CPU and GPU mining ensure wider participation without specialized, expensive hardware.
- **Resilience Against Centralization:** Prevents mining power from concentrating with entities that use ASICs or FPGAs.
- **Security and Network Stability:** Broader distribution of mining power strengthens the network against attacks and manipulation.
- **Community Participation:** Supports a diverse community of miners, developers, and stakeholders, fostering growth and sustainability.

In conclusion, Xelis prioritizes inclusive mining to protect decentralization, network security, and community engagement.

---

## Quick Project Review:

Over the past month, the Xelis community, miners, and developers have celebrated major milestones since the **mainnet launch on April 20, 2024**.

Xelis is a next-gen cryptocurrency built from scratch, featuring cutting-edge technologies:

- **BlockDAG architecture**
- **Homomorphic Encryption** using ElGamal
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** via Bulletproofs
- **Smart Contracts** (future support via XELIS-VM)
- Rust-based implementation for security and efficiency
- Event-driven system for enhanced monitoring and responsiveness
- **15-second blocks** for optimized transaction speed
- Account model (vs. UTXO) for flexibility and privacy
- Pruning system to manage blockchain size
- Encrypted P2P network with \`ChaCha20-Poly1305\`

Xelis continues pushing forward, blending technological innovation with a strong focus on **decentralization**, **security**, and **community involvement**.

# Comparison of Cryptocurrencies

The comparison chart in the provided document compares five cryptocurrencies: **XELIS**, **KASPA**, **MONERO**, **BITCOIN**, and **ETHEREUM**, across various attributes. 

## Blockchain Type: Blockchain vs. BlockDAG

**XELIS and KASPA:** Use BlockDAG.

**MONERO, BITCOIN, and ETHEREUM:** Use Blockchain.

### Blockchain:

- **Structure**: A linear sequence of blocks where each block contains a list of transactions. Each block is linked to the previous one via cryptographic hash, forming a single chain.
- **Confirmation Time**: Transactions need to be confirmed by adding them to a new block, which can lead to longer confirmation times as the chain grows.
- **Scalability**: Limited by the block size and block time, often leading to scalability issues as the number of transactions increases.
- **Security**: Highly secure due to the sequential and linear nature of the chain, making it difficult to alter previous blocks without re-mining all subsequent blocks.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Typically relies on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate transactions and add new blocks to the chain.
- **Examples**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero.

### BlockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph):

- **Structure**: A more complex structure where transactions are organized in a directed acyclic graph rather than a single chain. This allows multiple blocks to be created and confirmed simultaneously.
- **Confirmation Time**: Transactions can be confirmed more quickly since they do not need to wait for a single chain to extend. Multiple branches can process transactions concurrently.
- **Scalability**: Generally more scalable than traditional blockchains because it can handle a higher volume of transactions without congestion, leveraging parallelism.
- **Security**: Provides robust security but with a different approach. Instead of relying on a single chain of blocks, it uses a graph structure where transactions reference multiple predecessors, making it harder for attackers to rewrite history.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Uses mechanisms that can handle the non-linear structure, such as those enabling rapid and parallel block creation.
- **Examples**: IOTA, Fantom, KASPA, XELIS.

### Key Differences:

- **Structure**: Blockchain is linear; BlockDAG is a graph.
- **Confirmation Time**: Blockchain can be slower; BlockDAG is faster due to parallel processing.
- **Scalability**: Blockchain has inherent limits; BlockDAG is more scalable.
- **Security**: Both are secure, but BlockDAG uses different methods to ensure security across its graph structure.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Blockchain typically uses PoW or PoS; BlockDAG uses mechanisms suited for parallel validation.

In summary, while blockchains offer simplicity and strong security with a linear sequence of blocks, BlockDAGs provide enhanced scalability and faster transaction confirmation through a more complex graph structure that allows for parallel processing of transactions.

## Encryption vs. No Encryption in Blockchain

**XELIS:** Yes, on balances and transferred amounts.
**KASPA and BITCOIN:** No.
**MONERO:** Yes, on addresses, balances, and amounts.
**ETHEREUM:** No.

### Encryption in Blockchain:

- **Definition**: Encryption in blockchain involves using cryptographic algorithms to secure data, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the information.
- **Privacy**: Encrypts sensitive information such as transaction details, user identities, and balances, enhancing privacy.
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access and tampering with data. Even if the data is intercepted, it remains unreadable without the correct decryption key.
- **Anonymity**: Can offer higher levels of anonymity by obscuring user identities and transaction details.
- **Examples**: Monero employs encryption to provide enhanced privacy for transactions, making it difficult to trace the origin, destination, and amount involved in transactions.

### No Encryption in Blockchain:

- **Definition**: A blockchain with no encryption means that the data recorded on the blockchain is not obscured, and anyone with access to the blockchain can read the data.
- **Transparency**: Ensures that all transaction details are publicly accessible, providing complete transparency.
- **Auditability**: Facilitates easier auditing and verification of transactions since all data is openly available and can be scrutinized by anyone.
- **Performance**: May offer improved performance and reduced complexity, as encryption and decryption processes can be computationally intensive.
- **Examples**: Bitcoin does not use encryption for its transaction data, making all transaction details visible on the public ledger.

### Key Differences:

- **Privacy**:
  - Encryption: Ensures that transaction details and user identities are hidden, enhancing privacy.
  - No Encryption: Makes all transaction details public, reducing privacy.
  
- **Security**:
  - Encryption: Protects data from unauthorized access and tampering, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
  - No Encryption: Relies on the inherent security of the blockchain protocol to prevent tampering but does not obscure data.
  
- **Transparency**:
  - Encryption: Limits transparency to authorized parties, as encrypted data is not readily accessible to everyone.
  - No Encryption: Provides complete transparency, as all data is openly accessible.
  
- **Performance**:
  - Encryption: Can introduce additional computational overhead due to encryption and decryption processes.
  - No Encryption: Typically has better performance since there is no need for encryption-related computations.

### Use Cases:

- **Encryption**: Suitable for applications requiring high privacy and confidentiality, such as confidential financial transactions, private messaging, and sensitive data storage.
- **No Encryption**: Suitable for applications where transparency and public verification are crucial, such as public cryptocurrencies, supply chain tracking, and public records.

**Summary**: Encryption in blockchain enhances privacy and security by obscuring transaction details and user identities, making it suitable for applications requiring high confidentiality. On the other hand, blockchains without encryption prioritize transparency and public accessibility, making them ideal for applications where open access and verification are essential. The choice between using encryption or not depends on the specific requirements of the application and the desired balance between privacy, security, and transparency.

- **KASPA & BITCOIN**: No, only data insertion
- **ETHEREUM**: Yes

### Native Smart Contracts vs. Data Insertion:

- **Native Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with conditions written into code. **Use Cases**: DeFi, DApps, legal agreements, etc.
- **Data Insertion**: Inserting data into the blockchain without execution logic. **Use Cases**: Proof of existence, asset registration, etc.

### Smart Contract Programming Language:
- **XELIS**: XELIS VM (Golang-like).
- **KASPA, MONERO, and BITCOIN**: No.
- **ETHEREUM**: Solidity.

A smart contract programming language is a specialized programming language designed for creating and executing smart contracts on blockchain platforms. These languages are tailored to define the rules and conditions of a contract in a manner that can be automatically enforced by the blockchain network. Examples of these languages include Solidity and Go (or XELIS VM). Each of these languages is tailored to the specific blockchain platform they support, providing varying levels of functionality, security features, and ease of use depending on the requirements and goals of the blockchain network.

### Scalable Technology:
- **XELIS and KASPA**: Yes, BlockDAG.
- **MONERO, BITCOIN, and ETHEREUM**: No.

BlockDAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) are considered more scalable than traditional blockchains primarily due to their inherent structure and how they handle transactions and consensus. Here are several reasons why BlockDAGs can offer better scalability:

1. **Parallel Transactions**: In a BlockDAG, transactions can be processed concurrently rather than sequentially as in a blockchain. This parallel processing capability allows for higher throughput of transactions, thereby increasing the overall scalability of the network.

2. **Reduced Confirmation Times**: Since transactions in a BlockDAG can reference multiple previous transactions (not limited to a single chain), confirmation times for transactions can be significantly reduced. This is because transactions can be confirmed as soon as they are indirectly referenced by subsequent transactions, rather than waiting for them to be included in a block.

3. **Flexibility in Consensus**: BlockDAGs often employ consensus mechanisms that are more flexible and adaptive compared to traditional blockchain consensus algorithms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). These mechanisms can allow for faster consensus on transactions and better handling of network forks or conflicts.

4. **Scalable Validation**: Validators in a BlockDAG can validate transactions independently and in parallel, as they are not constrained by a single linear chain. This parallel validation further enhances the scalability of the network by distributing the computational load.

5. **Resilience to Forks**: BlockDAGs can handle and resolve forks more efficiently than traditional blockchains. This resilience is due to the nature of the DAG structure, where conflicting transactions can coexist and be resolved through consensus mechanisms that consider the overall structure of the DAG rather than just the longest chain.

6. **Dynamic Structure**: BlockDAGs can dynamically adjust their structure and grow more organically compared to blockchains, which often have fixed block intervals and block sizes. This adaptability allows BlockDAG networks to better accommodate varying transaction volumes and network conditions.

Overall, the scalability of BlockDAGs arises from their ability to process transactions in parallel, reduce confirmation times, employ flexible consensus mechanisms, and handle network forks efficiently. These characteristics make BlockDAGs a promising alternative for applications requiring high transaction throughput and scalability compared to traditional blockchain architectures.

### Fair Launch (No Premine or Presale):
- **XELIS, KASPA, MONERO, and BITCOIN**: Yes.
- **ETHEREUM**: No.

In the context of cryptocurrencies, a "fair launch" refers to the initial distribution of tokens or coins in a transparent and equitable manner. The concept emerged as a response to concerns about fairness and decentralization within crypto projects, particularly in contrast to projects that might use strategies like pre-mining or pre-sale allocations to insiders.

**Key characteristics of a fair launch in crypto include**:

- **Equal Opportunity**: All participants have an equal chance to obtain tokens or coins at the beginning of the project. This typically means that tokens are not pre-mined (created before public availability) or disproportionately allocated to a small group before being made available to the wider public.
  
- **Transparency**: The process of token distribution is transparent and openly communicated to the community. Details such as token issuance schedule, allocation methods, and any associated costs or fees are clearly disclosed.
  
- **Community Involvement**: There is often a focus on community participation and engagement. This can include mechanisms such as bounties, tips, and grants.

- **Decentralization**: The project aims to maintain decentralization from the start, meaning that no single entity or small group has undue control over the network or token supply. This is often tied to distribution methods that disperse tokens widely among users and stakeholders.

Fair launches are often seen as a way to foster trust and confidence among the cryptocurrency community, as they align with principles of decentralization and inclusivity. They aim to prevent centralization of wealth and power within the project's ecosystem, promoting a more open and equitable distribution of coins.

### Project Funding Mechanism in Protocol:
- **XELIS**: Yes, miner fee.
- **KASPA, MONERO, and BITCOIN**: No.
- **ETHEREUM**: Yes, premine.

Project funding is crucial in cryptocurrency projects for several reasons:

- **Development and Innovation**: Funding allows cryptocurrency projects to allocate resources towards research, development, and innovation. This includes hiring talented developers, engineers, and researchers who can contribute to improving the technology, enhancing security, and developing new features.

Funding helps cover the costs of servers, bandwidth, and other operational expenses necessary to keep the network running smoothly.
  
- **Marketing and Adoption**: Effective marketing is essential for attracting users, investors, and developers to the project. Funding supports marketing campaigns, community engagement efforts, and educational initiatives aimed at promoting the project and increasing adoption.
  
- **Legal and Regulatory Compliance**: As the cryptocurrency space evolves, navigating legal and regulatory landscapes becomes increasingly complex. Funding helps projects hire legal experts and consultants to ensure compliance with local regulations and navigate legal challenges.
  
- **Security Audits and Reviews**: Security is paramount in the cryptocurrency industry due to the potential for financial loss and vulnerabilities. Projects use funding to conduct regular security audits, penetration testing, and code reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
  
- **Partnerships and Collaborations**: Building strategic partnerships with other projects, businesses, and organizations can enhance the ecosystem and provide new opportunities for growth and adoption. Funding supports efforts to establish and maintain these partnerships, fostering collaboration and integration within the broader crypto community.
  
- **Long-term Sustainability**: Sustainable funding ensures the longevity and stability of the project. It allows teams to plan for the future, weather market fluctuations, and continue innovating over the long term without being solely reliant on short-term market conditions.

Overall, project funding is essential for cryptocurrency projects to grow, innovate, and achieve their goals in a competitive and rapidly evolving industry. It provides the necessary resources to build robust technology, attract users and investors, navigate regulatory challenges, and establish a strong foundation for long-term success.

### Account Model vs. UTXO Model:
- **XELIS and ETHEREUM**: Account.
- **KASPA, MONERO, and BITCOIN**: UTXO.

The account model and UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model are two different approaches to managing transactions and balances within blockchain systems. Here’s a comparison between the two:

#### UTXO Model:

- **Concept**: In the UTXO model, each transaction creates one or more Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). These UTXOs represent portions of cryptocurrency that have been received but not yet spent.
  
- **Transaction Structure**: When a transaction is made, it consumes one or more UTXOs as inputs and creates new UTXOs as outputs. The sum of inputs must equal the sum of outputs, ensuring that no cryptocurrency is created or destroyed, only transferred.

- **Verification**: The UTXO model allows for straightforward verification of transactions because each UTXO can be individually verified against the blockchain to ensure it has not been spent previously.

- **Scalability**: UTXOs can be processed in parallel, which can enhance scalability in terms of transaction throughput. However, managing a large number of UTXOs can also present challenges in terms of storage and computational efficiency.

#### Account Model:

- **Concept**: In the account model, users have accounts with balances, similar to bank accounts. Transactions involve updating account balances rather than referencing specific inputs and outputs like UTXOs.
  
- **Transaction Structure**: Transactions deduct from the sender’s account balance and add to the recipient’s account balance. Unlike the UTXO model, there’s no need to explicitly track and consume specific inputs (UTXOs) to create outputs.

- **Verification**: While straightforward for balance updates, verifying transactions in the account model typically requires more complex state management, as the entire account state must be considered to verify balances and prevent double-spending.

- **Scalability**: The account model simplifies state management and reduces the number of transactions needed to perform certain operations.

The superiority of the account model over the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model in blockchain systems depends on the context and specific goals of the system. Both models have their strengths and are suitable for different applications and implementations within the blockchain ecosystem.

### Max Supply:
- **XELIS and MONERO**: 18.4 million.
- **KASPA**: 28700 million.
- **BITCOIN**: 21 million.
- **ETHEREUM**: No max supply.

In cryptocurrency, the “max supply” refers to the maximum number of coins that will ever be created for that particular cryptocurrency. This concept is fundamental because it defines the ultimate scarcity and availability of the cryptocurrency in the long term.

### Fair Emissions:
- **XELIS**: 28% mined in first 2 years.
- **KASPA**: 72% mined in first 2 years.
- **MONERO**: 65% mined in first 2 years.
- **BITCOIN**: 25% mined in first 2 years.
- **ETHEREUM**: No max supply.

The concept of longer mining emissions being perceived as fair in cryptocurrency often relates to how new coins or tokens are introduced into circulation over time. Longer mining emissions can promote gradual distribution, equal opportunity, network security, and stability in the market perception of a cryptocurrency.

    title: 'Xelis Funding Strategy: Miner Block Fee vs. Community Donations',
    description: 'Understand the Xelis project funding strategy and why a temporary miner block fee was chosen over other funding models such as premine, presale or community donations.',
    content: `
## Xelis Development Fee and Funding Model

XELIS is a community-driven project without corporate or organizational funding. To support its development and ensure continuous growth, we have implemented a decreasing development fee starting at **10% of the miner block reward**. These funds are vital for establishing a robust early ecosystem and are exclusively used for **network development, marketing, and exchange expenses**.

### Development Fee Schedule:
- **10%** from block \`0\` to \`3,249,999\` (approximately 1.5 years with BlockDAG).
- **5%** from block \`3,250,000\` until the project stabilizes across major facets of the ecosystem.

The purpose of the fee halving design, with a higher fee earlier in the project, was to:
- Prevent early-stage mining domination during the low-difficulty stages.
- Help avoid centralization and possible market manipulation.
- Allow substantial early funding while the project is undiscovered.

Currently, Xelis dev fees are managed by the **core developers**. Once smart contracts are fully integrated, fees will be managed through a **Smart Contract with multiple trustees**, enabling the creation of a **DAO** for trustless and simple management. The fees are **temporary** and will decrease or be eliminated once the network can sustain itself.

---

## Why was Miner Fee chosen over Community Donation Model?

A **miner tax fee** was chosen over community donations for its **sustainability**, **predictability**, and **equitable distribution**. It ensures a consistent income stream by **automatically collecting funds from the mining process**, aiding in better financial planning and stability. This aligns miners’ incentives with **network security and development**, as they have a vested interest in the project’s success.

The miner tax fee **spreads the funding burden evenly**, reducing centralization risks.

In contrast, relying on **donations** is **unpredictable** and **dependent on market conditions**, leading to potential inconsistent funding and potential misalignment of interests. 

There is no doubt, donations can bring benefits by allowing **passionate community members** to contribute directly, fostering a sense of **ownership and engagement**.

Yet, this approach risks **over-reliance on a few large contributors**, which can lead to **disproportionate influence** over the project’s direction and **community fragmentation**.

---

### In summary:
A **miner tax fee** provides a more **reliable** and **fair approach**, supporting:
- Infrastructure
- Ongoing development
- Overall stability of the cryptocurrency ecosystem

While donations, although beneficial in fostering community spirit and providing rapid funding, pose significant risks in terms of:
- Funding consistency
- Centralization of influence

# The Risks of Public Ledger Transparency in Cryptocurrencies and the Case for Xelis

## Emma’s Story
Emma, a successful entrepreneur, walks into a local electronics store to purchase a new laptop. Eager to use her cryptocurrency holdings such as USDT, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Kaspa, she selects a sleek model and heads to the checkout lane. As she approaches the counter, she pulls out her smartphone to complete the payment using her cryptocurrency wallet.

Unbeknownst to Emma, the public ledger associated with the cryptocurrency she is using displays her wallet’s balance and recent transaction amounts in real-time. While she is busy confirming the payment amount on her phone, Jason, the person in line behind her, is silently monitoring the retailer's deposit address on his smartphone.

Jason, a seasoned fraudster, notices that Emma’s wallet contains a substantial amount of cryptocurrency. Seeing this as an opportunity, he follows Emma out of the store and to her house. As Emma gets out of her car to walk up to her house, Jason grabs Emma and forces her back into her car. He then demands that she gives him her private keys, or he will harm her and her family. Terrified, Emma complies with the requests of Jason and provides her private keys.

With access to her private key, Jason immediately drains Emma’s wallet of its substantial funds before law enforcement has even been notified. The once substantial cryptocurrency holdings she had are now gone, leaving her both financially and emotionally devastated.

While this hypothetical story seems extreme, it does illustrate the hidden dangers of public ledger transparency. While the blockchain offers transparency and immutability, it also exposes individuals to risks such as targeted fraud and theft when wallet balances and transaction amounts are visible to anyone. Emma’s case serves as a stark reminder of the need for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Xelis that protect users’ financial information from prying eyes and malicious actors.

## The Risks of Public Ledgers

### 1. Exposure to Theft and Fraud
Public ledgers provide a complete view of wallet balances and transaction histories. This transparency can be a double-edged sword. Malicious actors can easily identify high-value wallets and target their owners with phishing scams, hacking attempts, or physical theft. Once a hacker knows that a wallet holds substantial assets, they may be motivated to employ sophisticated techniques to gain access.

### 2. Increased Risk of Social Engineering
The visibility of wallet balances can make individuals more susceptible to social engineering schemes. For example, fraudsters may exploit the information to trick individuals into revealing private keys or performing transactions under false pretenses. The more a fraudster knows about a target’s financial status, the more convincing their scam can be.

### 3. Privacy Concerns
In a world where privacy is increasingly under threat, the public nature of blockchain transactions can be unsettling. Wallet balances and transaction amounts are visible to anyone with access to the blockchain, which can compromise personal and financial privacy. This lack of confidentiality is particularly concerning for individuals who value their financial discretion.

### 4. Potential for Market Manipulation
Transparency can also lead to market manipulation. Large holders of cryptocurrencies, often referred to as “whales,” can have their transactions tracked and potentially manipulated by market players who seek to exploit their actions. This visibility can undermine market stability and fairness.

## Xelis: A Safer Alternative

In response to these concerns, innovative cryptocurrencies like Xelis are emerging with features designed to address the privacy shortcomings of traditional public ledgers. Xelis introduces a more secure and private approach to digital transactions by incorporating encryption mechanisms that safeguard wallet balances and transaction amounts.

### 1. Encrypted Wallet Balances
Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, Xelis encrypts wallet balances, ensuring that the public cannot see how much money an individual holds. This encryption protects users from being targeted based on their financial status and reduces the risk of theft and fraud.

### 2. Privacy-First Transactions
When using Xelis, the details of a transaction are not visible to the public or merchants. This means that while transactions are recorded and verified, the amount of money involved is not transparent to the public, with only the recipient being able to see the transferred amounts. This approach aligns more closely with traditional financial systems, where transaction amounts and balances of users' wallets, accounts, and credit cards are not publicly accessible.

### 3. Enhanced Security
By obscuring financial information, Xelis reduces the risk of social engineering and other forms of financial manipulation. The lack of publicly available data means that attackers have less information to exploit, thereby improving overall security for users.

### 4. Facilitating Adoption
The privacy features of Xelis make it a more viable option for use in everyday transactions. Individuals and businesses alike can engage in cryptocurrency transactions without exposing sensitive financial information, thus making Xelis a more practical and secure medium of exchange.

## Conclusion
The public ledger transparency inherent in many cryptocurrencies, while beneficial for transparency and accountability, introduces significant risks related to privacy, security, and potential fraud. The ability to view wallet balances and transaction details publicly can lead to increased exposure to theft, social engineering, and market manipulation.

Xelis addresses these issues by incorporating encryption to safeguard wallet balances and transaction amounts, making it a more secure and private alternative. By ensuring that financial details are not publicly disclosed, Xelis aligns more closely with traditional financial systems in terms of privacy and security, providing a safer platform for cryptocurrency transactions.

As the digital financial landscape continues to evolve, the adoption of regulatory-compliant, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Xelis will become increasingly important in mitigating the risks associated with public ledger transparency and ensuring the secure use of digital assets.

# Vision of Smart Contracts on XELIS

The XELIS ecosystem is designed to support Layer 1 private smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) & assets using its native utility coin, **XELIS**. This coin will facilitate all transactions and fees within the network, including payments for smart contract execution, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Key Features of XELIS:

- **Utility Coin**: XELIS will be used for transaction fees, smart contract operations, and dApp interactions, promoting an integrated and efficient economic model.
- **Future Smart Contract Implementation**: While Smart Contracts are not yet available on the XELIS mainnet, their upcoming integration to testnet is expected to enhance the platform’s functionality and give a test environment for developers to start building.
- **XELIS Virtual Machine (XVM)**: The XVM is a dedicated execution environment that will utilize bytecode-compiled logic similar to EVM. It supports a robust set of programming constructs, providing developers with a familiar and powerful programming environment. Unlike EVM, XVM already supports several built-in types (string, bool, integers variants, arrays, and structs), helping developers utilize them more efficiently. Smart Contract programs will be built using:
  - **Assembler** (raw bytecode instructions)
  - **Silex** (a traditional programming language interpreted from Rust)

By leveraging XELIS as a universal medium for transactions and contract execution, the ecosystem aims to ensure efficient processing and foster growth and sustainability in private and high-performance blockchain applications.

---

## Smart Contract Development Update:

### Core Development of the Xelis VM

#### Key Components:

- **Lexer, Parser, Interpreter (Legacy), Compiler, and VM**: A complete pipeline is in place to handle code from tokenization to bytecode execution, forming the basis for smart contract processing.
- **Lexer**: Converts the Silex source code into tokens.
- **Parser**: Verifies the program structure and ensures validity.
- **Compiler**: Converts an AST program into a bytecode module.
- **VM**: Executes the finalized bytecode and ensures security within the blockchain environment.

#### Stack-Based VM:

Unlike EVM’s 256-bit architecture, XVM supports different data types directly within the VM, improving efficiency and performance. The 256-bit limitation in EVM has been a known bottleneck, and Xelis seeks to overcome this.

A Proof-of-Concept VM now successfully runs benchmarks like the **prime number finder** (1.085s for 5000 primes).

---

## Optimization Efforts

### Performance Gains:

- **Prime Benchmark** reduced from **2.739s** to **1.7658s** due to stack optimization.
- Further optimizations brought the time to **750ms**, approaching **Python’s performance (400ms-650ms)**.

### Optimizations Used:

- Prevented cloning of values using Rc/RefCell, improving stack handling.
- Adopted **lookup tables** for instruction processing, reducing dispatch times.

---

## Shunting Yard Algorithm & Non-Recursive Parsing

### Shunting Yard Algorithm:

- Handles **operator precedence** in mathematical expressions.
- Moves towards **iterative parsing** to prevent stack overflows in large expressions.

### Non-Recursive Parser:

- Eliminates recursion for expression parsing, improving scalability for complex smart contracts.

---

## Smart Contract Implementation

### Stack-Based VM:

- Supports smart contracts efficiently through a stack-based architecture.
- **Bytecode Representation**: Programs will be stored as bytecode, compressing functions and variables for better on-chain transparency.

### DAG Integration:

     # The Cryptocurrency Quadrilemma: Xelis' Approach to Decentralization, Security, Scalability, and Privacy

## Introduction
Cryptocurrencies have revolutionized the financial world, promising decentralized and permissionless financial transactions on a global scale. At the core of this promise lies blockchain technology, which enables cryptocurrencies to function without central authorities such as banks or governments. However, this promise comes with challenges, leading to fundamental trade-offs known as the **cryptocurrency trilemma**—a framework highlighting three conflicting goals: **decentralization, security, and scalability**.

In this essay, we explore the origins and implications of the trilemma and introduce a fourth pillar—**privacy**—evolving it into the **Quadrilemma**. We will also examine how **Xelis** seeks to solve these challenges comprehensively.

## The Cryptocurrency Trilemma
Popularized by **Vitalik Buterin**, the **cryptocurrency trilemma** presents three core properties that every blockchain seeks to optimize:
![Trilemma Diagram](/uploads/blog/quadlemma2.png)
- **Decentralization**: Ensuring no single entity controls the system.
- **Security**: Protecting against fraud, hacks, and manipulation.
- **Scalability**: Enabling efficient transaction processing at scale.

### Decentralization
Decentralization ensures that no single entity can manipulate or control the system, making it resistant to censorship and corruption. However, the more decentralized a blockchain is, the more complex consensus mechanisms become, potentially **slowing down transaction speeds**.

### Security
A secure blockchain is one where transactions are immutable and resistant to attacks. However, prioritizing security often requires high computational resources, which can **limit scalability**.

### Scalability
Scalability is the ability of a blockchain to handle a growing number of transactions. Achieving scalability often involves **sacrificing decentralization** or using faster consensus mechanisms that might be **less secure**.

## Introducing the Quadrilemma: Adding Privacy
While the trilemma offers a valuable framework, another crucial factor must be considered: **privacy**. Many cryptocurrency users are concerned with the transparency of blockchain transactions, leading to the evolution of the trilemma into a **Quadrilemma**.
![Trilemma Diagram](/uploads/blog/quadlemma3.png)
### Privacy
Privacy ensures that users can transact without exposing sensitive financial data. While blockchains like **Bitcoin** provide pseudonymity, they lack full privacy. Solutions like **Monero and Zcash** use **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** and **homomorphic encryption** to enhance privacy. However, privacy features often **increase computational overhead**, affecting scalability.

## The Quadrilemma and Xelis: A Comprehensive Solution
Xelis, a **Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency**, addresses the **Quadrilemma** by balancing **decentralization, security, scalability, and privacy**. Here’s how:

### 1. Decentralization in Xelis
Xelis employs an **ASIC-resistant PoW algorithm** to ensure mining remains accessible to **CPU and GPU miners**, preventing mining centralization. This maintains decentralization and **prevents domination by industrial mining farms**.

### 2. Security in Xelis
Xelis leverages **PoW consensus with a BlockDAG architecture** to enhance security while maintaining decentralization. **Homomorphic encryption** is integrated to protect transaction details, ensuring financial data remains private while keeping the system secure.

### 3. Scalability in Xelis
To improve scalability, Xelis implements a **BlockDAG architecture** and optimized transaction validation, allowing higher transaction throughput. Key scalability features include:

- **1.25MB block size** with **15-second block times**
- **Efficient transaction finality** without relying on **Layer-2 solutions**

### 4. Privacy in Xelis
Xelis integrates **homomorphic encryption** and **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** to balance privacy with compliance. **ElGamal encryption** ensures transaction amounts and wallet balances remain confidential while keeping sender and receiver addresses public.

## The Quadrilemma Solution: Xelis’ Balanced Approach
Xelis successfully balances all four pillars of the **Quadrilemma**:

- **Decentralization**: ASIC-resistant PoW ensures distributed mining.
- **Security**: BlockDAG and cryptographic techniques safeguard transactions.
- **Scalability**: Efficient block sizes and fast confirmations optimize transaction throughput.
- **Privacy**: Built-in homomorphic encryption and ZKPs maintain confidentiality without sacrificing compliance.

## Conclusion
Xelis pioneers a new era of **balanced blockchain development**, proving that decentralization, security, scalability, and privacy **do not have to be mutually exclusive**. Unlike traditional blockchains that sacrifice one pillar to enhance another, Xelis ensures a **harmonized and sustainable** approach.

By addressing the **Quadrilemma**, Xelis **sets a new standard for next-generation cryptocurrencies**, offering users a truly decentralized, secure, scalable, and privacy-centric financial system.

This enhancement will contribute to a smoother onboarding experience for new users and nodes.

## 4. New Xelis WooCommerce Payment Plugin
Exciting news for e-commerce users: we’re developing a new WooCommerce payment plugin! This plugin will facilitate seamless transactions using Xelis on WooCommerce-powered sites, making it easier for businesses to accept Xelis as a payment option. This plugin will work as a proxy to your real wallet address by setting up a “hot wallet” on your website to receive all transactions, and once confirmed, they are automatically moved to the configured wallet address. Wrong amounts/transactions will be automatically refunded to the payer. 

This plugin differs from our other solution, **XELISPay**, which is a standalone library that can be included in any website for greater control. The WooCommerce plugin is a one-click solution to accept XELIS payments on e-commerce shops. The first implementation of this Payment Application is expected to be utilized in the upcoming third-party-run **XELIS MERCH Store**.

    title: 'The Road to Testnet: Xelis Smart Contracts and VM Update',
    description: 'Discover the latest advancements in Xelis as we prepare for the Testnet launch of our Smart Contracts and Virtual Machine (VM). This article provides an in-depth look at the current status.',
    content: `
XELIS continues to progress forward in its Layer 1 blockDAG platform, expertly designed to support secure and scalable encrypted smart contracts and decentralized applications. By harnessing the power of its native utility coin, XELIS efficiently manages transaction fees and contract execution, providing a seamless and secure experience for decentralized operations.

### Key Features and Virtual Machine Advancements

The core of the XELIS ecosystem is the XELIS Virtual Machine (XVM), designed to execute smart contracts through a stack-based architecture. XVM offers support for various data types, including integers, strings, booleans, arrays, and structs, giving developers versatility in designing smart contracts.

XVM allows developers to write smart contracts using either low-level assembly or a higher-level syntax called Silex, a Rust-inspired language. This provides flexibility, catering to both low-level system developers and those who prefer more abstraction.

While this approach bears similarities to Ethereum’s EVM, which offers mnemonic assembly and high-level languages like Solidity, XVM differentiates through its higher level of abstraction for its assembly level which should make it easier for smart contract developers. As well as the potential for increased performance.

### Progress and Performance Updates

Recent development in the XELIS ecosystem has been centered on improving XVM’s performance and functionality. Key enhancements have been made to stack operations, including the introduction of mem::take, a Rust function that allows developers to efficiently retrieve and remove a value from a mutable reference by replacing it with a default value. This avoids the need to clone or copy data, leading to faster pop_stack execution and significantly boosting performance.

The development team is also evaluating the potential advantages of optimizing push_stack operations, although the improvement over standard vector operations is still under review.

While the Shunting Yard Algorithm has not yet been implemented, significant improvements have been made to its design. The updated algorithm, which handles operator precedence in mathematical expressions, is expected to improve non-recursive parsing, enhancing memory management and preventing stack overflows when executing complex smart contracts. Its integration will mark a major step forward in the VM’s functionality.

Additionally, the lead developer is focused on implementing all missing opcodes, optimizing the virtual machine, and cleaning up the existing codebase. There’s also consideration for reworking the entire system to use a class-based hierarchy instead of structs. This rework could enhance the modularity of the system, making it easier to develop more complex smart contracts and decentralized applications.

Optimizations such as eliminating unnecessary value cloning, improving instruction dispatch times through lookup tables, and better memory management in nested loops have already led to significant performance gains. For example, the prime number benchmark time has been reduced from 2.7 seconds to 750 milliseconds, highlighting the efficiency improvements achieved so far.

### Smart Contract Innovation and Dynamic Token Management

XELIS is advancing its smart contract architecture with plans to move from a struct-based system to a class-based hierarchy. This shift will allow for real inheritance, making contract design more modular and facilitating cross-contract interactions. This change will simplify the development of more complex decentralized applications, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and NFT platforms.

In addition, XELIS is working on implementing dynamic token management within smart contracts. This will enable contracts to generate and manage multiple tokens or NFTs within a single contract, giving developers greater flexibility and control over digital assets in decentralized financial applications.

### Collaboration and Community Involvement

The XELIS project greatly benefits from its active developer community. Contributions through GitHub and community discussions have played a key role in optimizing the XVM and shaping its future. The collaboration between the development team and the community ensures that XVM remains robust, secure, and capable of supporting a wide variety of decentralized applications.

### Conclusion: Innovation in Encrypted Smart Contracts

As XELIS advances towards integrating smart contracts into its testnet, the platform is on the verge of a groundbreaking impact on the blockchain ecosystem. With its emphasis on encryption, security, and high-performance capabilities, the XELIS Virtual Machine (XVM) offers developers a robust and adaptable framework for crafting secure and scalable decentralized applications.

Continuous enhancements to its architecture, including advancements in stack handling, memory management, and cryptographic security, position XELIS at the cutting edge of blockchain innovation.

**As smart contracts come to life on XELIS, the ecosystem will unlock unprecedented opportunities for developers and users to create and engage with secure, and decentralized applications that set a new standard for the industry.**

# XELIS Whitepaper Release: A Milestone in Decentralized Technology

  Today marks a milestone in the development of decentralized technology with the release of the XELIS whitepaper, **“XELIS: A High-Performance BlockDAG for Private, Instant, and Scalable Decentralized Transactions and Applications.”** This comprehensive document is the foundation for XELIS, a next-generation blockchain platform uniquely designed to empower decentralized applications and private, instant, and scalable transactions. You can read the full whitepaper here: [XELIS Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.xelis.io).

  ## Addressing the Limitations of Traditional Blockchain

  Blockchain technology has made revolutionary strides in digital asset ownership, privacy, and decentralization. However, these advancements have exposed significant limitations in the traditional blockchain architecture, particularly around scalability, speed, and privacy. As networks grow and transaction volumes increase, issues like congestion, high fees, and long confirmation times become challenging.

  ## The BlockDAG Solution

  To overcome these limitations, the XELIS platform leverages a **BlockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) architecture**. Unlike traditional blockchains that arrange transactions linearly, a BlockDAG allows for multiple blocks to be added simultaneously. This innovation fundamentally enhances throughput and network efficiency, making XELIS capable of supporting a much larger volume of decentralized applications and real-time transactions.

  In addition to efficiency gains, the BlockDAG architecture allows XELIS to process a high volume of transactions almost **instantaneously**—a game-changer for applications requiring near-instant confirmation.

  ## The Privacy Solution

  Privacy is increasingly a focal point in decentralized networks, as users demand stronger safeguards for their data. XELIS recognizes this need and implements a targeted privacy solution utilizing **homomorphic encryption**. Rather than encrypting all transaction details, XELIS specifically focuses on transaction amounts and account balances. This ensures that while these data remain confidential, other transaction metadata needed for validation and consensus can still be verified by the network.

  ### Homomorphic Encryption on Transaction Amounts and Balances

  By applying **homomorphic encryption** solely to transaction amounts and balances, XELIS achieves a balance between **privacy and performance**. Users' financial information stays private, and encrypted values can be computed within the encrypted domain without revealing exact figures. This ensures validation without compromising transparency and decentralization.

  ## Key Innovations in XELIS

  - **High-Performance Transactions:** The BlockDAG model enables parallel block creation, maximizing network speed without sacrificing security.
  - **Enhanced Privacy and Security:** Advanced cryptographic techniques ensure transaction data and wallet balances remain private.
  - **Scalable Infrastructure for dApps:** Built to support scalability without degrading network performance.
  - **Decentralized Consensus Mechanism:** A CPU/GPU Proof of Work mechanism ensures decentralization and security.

  ## The Broader Vision of XELIS

  The release of the XELIS whitepaper is more than just a technical document—it’s a blueprint for a transformative digital ecosystem. **XELIS envisions a future where decentralized applications are not limited by performance bottlenecks or privacy concerns.**

  In addition to revolutionizing decentralized finance (DeFi), XELIS opens the door for a new generation of decentralized applications and use cases that were previously out of reach.

  ## Join Us on the Journey

  We’re excited to share this whitepaper with the community and invite all developers, researchers, and blockchain enthusiasts to review our manuscript, provide feedback, and engage in the conversation about the future of decentralized technology.

 # XELIS Introduces Balance Proofs and Ownership Proofs

The XELIS project recently introduced **Balance Proofs** and **Ownership Proofs** as part of its network upgrade, adding a system for securely disclosing wallet balances in a selective, verifiable manner. These features allow users to temporarily share the value of an encrypted balance or prove ownership of a minimum amount of assets without compromising long-term privacy. The proofs are designed to become invalid when the balance changes, maintaining privacy while enabling controlled transparency.

## Background: XELIS Before Balance Proofs

Prior to the addition of Balance and Ownership Proofs, XELIS operated with strict privacy measures, ensuring that all user balances and transaction data were fully encrypted and private. This encryption meant that no one, not even the development team, could verify wallet balances or trace transactions without the user’s explicit consent. While this absolute privacy was beneficial for security, it also limited balance verification for purposes like auditing or regulatory compliance. 

## Balance Proofs in XELIS

**Balance Proofs** allow users to create a one-time proof of their exact balance, valid only for the current state of the wallet. The Balance Proof becomes invalid once any transaction is made, ensuring that shared information does not expose ongoing transaction data. Using **Pedersen Commitments** and **Commitment Equality Proofs**, Balance Proofs verify the balance without revealing any transaction details, leveraging zero-knowledge principles to confirm the balance’s validity.

The technical process behind Balance Proofs involves creating a new ciphertext with the entire balance in the wallet, ensuring cryptographic consistency. A commitment equality proof is then generated to show that this “zero” balance ciphertext indeed represents zero, without leaking other details. This proof structure maintains the privacy of the wallet while allowing for verifiable disclosures. 

Through the future **Human Readable Proof** format, which uses the **Bech32 encoding** like wallet addresses, users will be able to share proofs securely and easily with third parties (including applications and services).

## Ownership Proofs in XELIS

**Ownership Proofs** enable users to prove that they own at least a specified amount, named **N**, of a given asset, without disclosing the full balance. Users can configure N to any value above 0, providing flexibility for cases where they need to demonstrate minimum holdings rather than an exact balance. Ownership Proofs are particularly useful in scenarios where a user needs to show sufficient funds to engage in a transaction or meet a financial threshold without disclosing the entire balance.

Ownership Proofs use similar cryptographic principles as Balance Proofs, including **Pedersen Commitments** and **zero-knowledge proof methods**. The process ensures that only the necessary information (the fact that the user holds at least **N** units of an asset) is shared, while all other balance details remain encrypted and private. Additionally, Ownership Proofs expire once the wallet’s balance is updated, maintaining data integrity and privacy by preventing reuse or unauthorized sharing of outdated information.

## Potential Applications and Regulatory Implications

### Balance Proofs
By introducing Balance Proofs, XELIS has opened the door to **selective transparency**. This feature can aid in addressing regulatory requirements, such as one-time audits or balance verifications, allowing institutions or regulatory bodies to confirm wallet balances without needing access to private keys or continuous transaction histories. This aligns with compliance standards, including **anti-money laundering (AML)** and **Know Your Customer (KYC)**, providing a controlled and privacy-preserving solution for temporary visibility.

### Ownership Proofs
Ownership Proofs offer additional compliance capabilities by enabling users to demonstrate **minimum holdings** without revealing their full balance. This is ideal for scenarios where users must prove that they meet financial requirements or minimum holdings for eligibility in transactions, investments, or other financial interactions. 

For XELIS, this feature enhances the network’s utility by allowing verifiable, minimal disclosures that maintain high privacy levels, fulfilling potential regulatory demands while safeguarding user anonymity.

## Conclusion

With **Balance and Ownership Proofs**, XELIS has introduced a robust framework for selective, verifiable balance disclosures. These features enable users and the development team to provide transparency while preserving privacy. By combining **zero-knowledge proofs** with **flexible encoding methods**, XELIS supports one-time verifications for regulatory needs and transaction eligibility. This balance of transparency and privacy strengthens XELIS’s commitment to **user-focused privacy and compliance**.
