It's been another productive month for Xelis, with significant progress across several core projects and initiatives. While many of the latest developments may fly under the radar for newcomers, they're laying a strong foundation for major growth in 2025.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Highlights

### 1.) Block Speed Reduction (5 seconds) launched on¬†Testnet  
![5 Second Blocktimes](/uploads/blog/5sec.jpg)
On May 22nd the XELIS Project announced a major upgrade that marks a significant milestone for a privacy-focused blockchain technology. In a bold leap forward, XELIS has reduced its testnet block times from 15 seconds to just 5 seconds, delivering a threefold increase in speed‚Ää-‚Ääwithout altering its core consensus protocol. This improvement to testnet paves the path to block speed reduction on our mainnet as we head towards Smart Contracts becoming live on Mainnet.  

Xelis has once again delivered on its promises‚Ää-‚Ääproving that 15-second block times were just the beginning. Our long-term goal has always been to maintain a lightweight, fully immutable ledger. We've been intentional in our approach, choosing not to accelerate block times prematurely. By waiting for real network usage before scaling, we avoid unnecessary bloat from empty blocks and ensure the network remains efficient and sustainable. This stands in contrast to many fast block speed chains that are forced to implement pruning due to excessive blockchain bloat (ie. Kaspa).

### 2.) Xelis Node Database Rewrite to RocksDB from¬†Sled  

This May Xelis completed an overhaul of the blockchain's database layer. The project has transitioned from using Sled, an embedded database engine, to RocksDB, a high-performance key-value store known for its efficiency and low-latency operation. The results are nothing short of impressive:  

üíΩ Disk Usage: Reduced from 15GB to just 4GB  
üß† RAM Consumption: Significantly reduced  
‚úçÔ∏è Code Rewritten: Over 10,000 lines of code revamped  
‚ö° Syncing: Now faster, lighter, and more stable than ever  

And perhaps most notably, all of these improvements come without changing the blockchain's consensus model, preserving the cryptographic integrity and trustless nature of the network.

üß© **A Boost for Low-Spec Nodes**  
In a space where many chains require powerful hardware to run nodes or rely on forced ledger pruning to keep nodes viable, XELIS is going in a different direction. This database update further enables full immutable ledgers to be maintained even on low-spec hardware such as Raspberry Pi's, making it far more accessible to run a full node. That means greater decentralization, improved network resilience, and a lower barrier to entry for developers and users alike.

üõ† **Open Source and Transparent**  
As always, XELIS continues to embrace transparency and open-source principles. The full differences of the database transition is available on GitHub: https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-blockchain/pull/115

### 3.) Xelis Genesix Wallet Update¬†0.0.8  
![Genesix 0.0.8 Update](/uploads/blog/genesix8.png)
Genesix Wallet Version 0.0.8 brings forth probably the most impactful updates since we launched our native desktop and mobile wallet.  

‚úÖ **Full XSWD integration**‚Ää-‚Ääa user-managed, device-only permission layer for connecting to dApps and DeFi. (no third-party servers like WalletConnect!) This update is critical for our upcoming smart contracts and DeFi. Want to test XSWD? Dive in on testnet to https://xelisforge.app our token launching tool, and connect your wallet to the forge via XSWD.  

‚úÖ **Built-in address book and enhanced UI**. Now you can save your most frequently interacted with addresses  

‚úÖ **Multi-signature Wallets**‚Ää-‚ÄäRequire multiple approvals for transactions + view-only mode. This allows wallets to be utilized by groups/entities requiring a minimum # of signatures to send funds. It can also strategically be used by single users to further secure their wallet needing two separate seed phrases/wallets to send transactions.  

‚úÖ **Biometric Authentication**- Use Face ID, fingerprint & more for quick, secure access on mobile (android).  

‚úÖ **Confidential Asset Tracking**‚Ää-‚ÄäAuto-detect & manage soon-to-be launched confidential tokens on Xelis L1  

‚úÖ **UX & Performance Upgrades**: 1.) Tx History Overhaul‚Ää-‚ÄäSmoothly navigate large lists with filters & lazy loading. 2.) Precomputed Tables‚Ää-‚ÄäInstant background table generation = zero wait time. 3.) General Fixes‚Ää-‚ÄäBug fixes, UI polish, and speed enhancements throughout.

### 4.) Node Stability & Stress¬†Testing  
May was a month of deep testing and critical improvements for the Xelis network. Our core focus was on node stability, stress testing, and validating performance under the new infrastructure updates.  

üîß Key highlights:  
- Successfully tested the new RocksDB integration, a major upgrade aimed at improving data handling and long-term scalability.  
- Continued testing of 5-second block times on testnet, pushing the network on it's speed performance.  
- Identified and addressed several core issues affecting node syncing, stability, deadlocks and transaction processing throughput.  

To support this, our developers launched "Xelis Storm"‚Ää-‚Ääan automated tool that spams the network with thousands of transactions to simulate high-load conditions and expose weaknesses. To date, we have already spammed the testnet with over 2 million transactions in just a couple weeks of our testing period  

These efforts are laying the groundwork for a faster, more robust Xelis mainnet as we move toward smart contract deployment in 2025.

### 5.) Xelis Token DEX (decentralized exchange)  

The community development team, led by Dalkson and Triton, continued progress on the first iteration of a decentralized exchange (DEX)‚Ää-‚Ääa key component of the Xelis ecosystem. Similar in concept to platforms like Uniswap or PancakeSwap, this DEX will be essential to have in place prior to the launch of Smart Contracts and XELIS Tokens on mainnet, as day-one trading will play a vital role in the network's early success.  

During this development phase, the team has been focused on building and refining the backend architecture, making significant strides toward completing the core framework that will power the exchange.

### 6.) Another Multi-Asset Wallet Integration  

Following up our success in implementing Xelis in Stack Wallet, a popular-privacy focused multi-asset wallet. The Xelis development team led by Triton is working again on another popular multi-asset wallet implementation that will not only include Xelis, but also our future Xelis Tokens. While the details are still confidential, you can be sure this will be big news for our users & the future Xelis ecosystem!

- **Optimized for smart contracts**  
- **Different in structure**, lacking features like:
  - References  
  - Mutable/immutable variables  
  - Traits  
  - Function implementations on structs

Current Issue: Mathematical operations don‚Äôt adhere to proper precedence rules.  
Task: Implement the Shunting Yard algorithm to ensure expressions are parsed correctly.

2. Parser Optimization  
Current Issue: Operates in full recursive mode, risking stack overflow for deeply nested expressions.  
Task: Rewrite key components to iterative logic to handle complexity more robustly.

3. File Imports  
Current Need: Enhance code organization by enabling the importing of other files.  
Task: Develop an import system for better modularity.

4. ABI (Application Binary Interface) Generation  
Objective: Generate ‚Äúmapper‚Äù files to link entry functions, enums, and structs to their corresponding chain IDs.  
Benefits: Simplifies integration with the upcoming XSWD library and facilitates dApp development.

5. VM Optimizations  
Objective: Enhance the VM‚Äôs speed to reduce smart contract execution costs.  
Focus Areas: Optimize performance to support scalability and lower transaction fees.

## Why This Xelis Team Q&A?

We believe that a strong connection between the team and the community is the foundation of any successful project. By introducing the personalities of our team, we aim to foster transparency, and collaboration. This article is not just about us sharing our journey; it‚Äôs about giving you, our valued community members, an inside look at what drives Xelis forward.


## Personal Background of Team

**Can you share a bit about your background and what led you to the cryptocurrency space?**

**Slixe:**
I don‚Äôt have a particularly unique background ‚Äî I‚Äôm just a regular guy who loves coding, cryptocurrencies and new technologies. I‚Äôm passionate about learning new things every day. My interest in the crypto world began with mining. I started CPU mining Monero and then moved to GPU mining Ethereum. Later, I joined a project as a community member and stayed there for several years until finally deciding to create my own vision ‚ÄúXELIS‚Äù with our wonderful team.

**G45:**
Interestingly, my background isn‚Äôt closely related to the tech sector. For a significant portion of my life, I was a farmer on a family-owned traditional farm and later started my own vegetable farm. During that time, I realized the need for better logistics and infrastructure, as farming can be draining both financially and mentally.

I was always fascinated by technology, which became my escape from the mundane repetition of farming. I spent my nights exploring technology and learning how to become a developer. After several years of freelance work, I found myself diving into the cryptocurrency world. I was intrigued by the idea of decentralized currency ‚Äî an open-source code that could help manage a global economy without boundaries. My journey led me to explore Monero and other cryptocurrencies, which sparked my desire to improve privacy in the digital space.

My passion eventually led me to Slixe, and together, we decided to turn our vision for XELIS into a reality.

**Ezekiel:**
I‚Äôm a Java backend developer at a central bank in Europe, working on an app for exchanging and transferring fiat currency between banks. By day, I‚Äôm focused on finance, but by night, I dive into crypto development, working on the wallet part of the XELIS project. I‚Äôve always been fascinated by cypherpunk visions of privacy and decentralized consensus, which led me to various communities over the years. Eventually, I crossed paths with Slixe, and that‚Äôs when the adventure began!

**Yar:**
I‚Äôve always been passionate about exploring new technologies and financial tools. My curiosity led me to cryptocurrency, especially the concept of decentralization and its potential to reshape financial systems. The transparency that blockchain technology offers, combined with the possibility of global empowerment, truly fascinated me. This interest evolved into a deeper understanding of cryptocurrencies and their potential to drive innovation across industries.

**Cyber:**
By education and experience, I am a business leader with a strong background in finance, marketing, business development, customer acquisition, and establishing partnerships. My career has been centered in the biotech sector, working for a Fortune 500 company, where I honed these skills.

My journey into the world of cryptocurrency began as a miner, driven by my passion for technology and hardware. What started as a technical curiosity quickly evolved into a deeper realization: the decentralized nature of crypto projects creates a unique space where business acumen and strategic thinking can thrive. In a landscape where proof of participation is the only barrier to entry, I discovered that my expertise in building connections and driving growth translated seamlessly. Crypto has since become both a professional and a personal passion, merging innovation with collaboration in exciting new ways.

**What inspired you to be part of the Xelis project specifically?**

**Slixe:**
What inspired me to join the Xelis project was the desire to create something new that aligned with our vision. I wanted to build something bigger and better while learning along the way. XELIS is a challenge for me, a personal journey to create a confidential, fully decentralized version of Ethereum that can be used in the real world.

**G45:**
I‚Äôm inspired by Slixe‚Äôs ability to work quickly and create complex systems. The Xelis project represents the future of a world with multiple global currencies that are not tied to any one country, and I want to contribute to that vision. I‚Äôm eager to help build Xelis and be part of this exciting innovation.

**Ezekiel:**
My journey with Xelis began organically. I started talking to Slixe about cryptocurrency, got interested in his work, and eventually started testing the tools he was developing. I was fascinated by the idea of creating a wallet with Flutter and Dart, and after many iterations, we managed to integrate Rust with the Xelis libraries. The challenge of building Genesix from scratch was thrilling and ultimately very rewarding.

**Yar:**
The originality of the Xelis concept and the professionalism of the team inspired me to join. It‚Äôs rare to see such a unique project backed by a group of individuals with deep expertise and a shared passion for innovation. The team‚Äôs dedication to pushing boundaries resonated with me, and I wanted to be a part of it.

**Cyber:**
I was inspired by the excellence and dedication of the Xelis development team. As Xelis began to take shape on testnet in 2023, it became clear that this team had a rare combination of technical brilliance and vision. I recognized this early on, which compelled me to contribute from a business & marketing perspective.

Now that you‚Äôve had the opportunity to meet the brilliant minds behind Xelis, it‚Äôs time to shift our focus to the heart of the project itself. At Xelis, we‚Äôre not just building another cryptocurrency ‚Äî we‚Äôre redefining what decentralized technology can achieve. From our mission to empower individuals with true financial privacy to our innovations in blockchain technology, Xelis is a project designed to challenge the status quo.

In this next segment, we‚Äôll delve deeper into what makes Xelis unique.


## Project Vision and Goals

**What is the core mission of Xelis, and what problems does it aim to solve?**

Xelis aims to redefine what cryptocurrency stands for: decentralized, powered by community, and built for independence.

Our goal is to tackle several challenges within the cryptocurrency space. First, we use an egalitarian Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm that allows for mining with both CPUs and GPUs, enhancing decentralization.

Second, in order for cryptocurrency to be used for daily payments, we need to ensure fast transactions that can compete with credit card networks. We address this by utilizing a BlockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) and several optimizations to achieve speed and scalability.

Finally, confidentiality & privacy is at the heart of Xelis. We believe that individuals should have control over their financial data, ensuring that no one can see your ‚Äúbank account‚Äù balance or track your spending amounts.

All of this is brought together in our user-friendly application, Genesix, which will onboard anyone, regardless of their experience level.

**How do you envision Xelis impacting the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem?**

We aim to educate people on the importance of confidentiality for real-world cryptocurrency usage. Privacy is essential for individuals to have control over their financial information, and Xelis hopes to lead this shift in the broader crypto space.

**What long-term goals do you have for Xelis in the next 5‚Äì10 years?**

Our goal is to become one of the fastest and most widely used networks. If we achieve this, we will have successfully provided privacy and scalability to a large number of people, enabling widespread adoption of decentralized finance.


## Development and Technology

**What unique features or innovations does Xelis offer compared to other cryptocurrencies?**

Xelis introduces several unique features:

- BlockDAG in the Account Model: Xelis is the first BlockDAG implementation with an account model, providing scalability and performance.
- Homomorphic Encryption for Privacy: Xelis is the first mainnet BlockDAG to implement privacy through Homomorphic Encryption, ensuring that user transactions amounts and wallet balances are private and secure.
- Integration Tools: We provide SDKs and APIs, making it easier to integrate our chain into other projects.
- Ownership and Balance Proofs: Xelis offers unique proofs, such as Ownership Proofs (to prove ownership of any asset) and Balance Proofs (to securely prove your encrypted balance without revealing your wallet).
- Virtual Machine (XVM): Xelis has a highly customizable Virtual Machine that is fast, secure, and ideal for integrating decentralized applications (dApps) or plugins.

**Can you explain the technology behind Xelis and what sets it apart?**

Xelis uses a BlockDAG structure for fast and scalable transactions. This unique architecture allows us to achieve high throughput without compromising security or decentralization.

One of the key differentiators is the use of Homomorphic Encryption. This technology allows us to process encrypted data without decrypting it, ensuring that sensitive information remains private.

Our XVM and Smart Contract architecture is designed to be highly customizable, offering a safe sandbox for developers to create decentralized applications. The speed and flexibility of the XVM make it an ideal platform for building scalable and secure dApps.

**What challenges have you faced during the development of Xelis, and how did you overcome them?**

The biggest challenge was addressing all the front-running issues that can occur with the use of ZK Proofs in the account model. The account model functions as a value updated with each action, similar to how websites manage their user databases. A front-running issue could arise if Alice sent some coins to Bob, but Bob had already initiated a transaction. Bob‚Äôs transaction would then become invalid because Alice‚Äôs update to Bob‚Äôs balance would make the ZK Proofs completely outdated, resulting in an invalid transaction.

Most cryptocurrencies handle this by maintaining two balances: a locked balance and an unlocked balance. The unlocked balance is only spendable after a set period. However, we didn‚Äôt want to implement this because we aimed for instant finality, allowing coins to be spent immediately in the next block after they are received.

To achieve this, we needed to track each version of a balance. Essentially, we created a list of all balances stored by the topoheight of the action that updated the balance. Each balance version consists of two parts:

- The ‚Äúoutput‚Äù balance: This contains the balance minus the total spent by the user in the block.
- The final balance: This contains the current balance plus all inputs received, minus all outputs spent.

We then introduced a ‚Äúreference‚Äù type in the transaction to correctly select the balance for ZK Proof verification. This ensures that an older balance cannot be used instead of the latest output balance, preventing double spending. The reference is the key innovation that keeps ZK Proofs completely valid, even when other coins are sent or received.

For instance, if we perform three transactions (TXs) simultaneously with the same reference, but one of the three TXs is executed in the next block, it‚Äôs fine. The protocol will simply fall back to the latest ‚Äúoutput‚Äù balance instead of selecting the referenced one. If Alice sends us coins while we‚Äôve already initiated a TX, that‚Äôs also fine. The reference topoheight can be lower than the latest balance topoheight available, provided no coins have been spent in that interval.

The protocol uses the referenced balance for verification, while for storage and final balance, it takes the latest available balance. It applies Homomorphic Encryption operations on this balance, ensuring it includes all inputs and outputs, making it fully usable in the next block.

The second biggest challenge was rewriting the BlockDAG execution order. We needed to track all changes occurring within a block to easily ‚Äúundo‚Äù the actions and rewrite them if necessary. To achieve this, we created our own layer for tracking changes by storing DAG-dependent data based on the topoheight. We also developed custom ‚Äúpointers‚Äù to reference the latest value available.

To prevent significant performance loss, we implemented caching to reduce frequent read/write operations on the database. Additionally, we verified the execution order to avoid re-executing everything unnecessarily. Instead, we identified the changes and determined where to start recalculations, using the appropriate topoheight or block hash as the baseline.


## Community Engagement

**How do you plan to engage with the Xelis community, and what role does community feedback play in your development process?**

We place a strong emphasis on community engagement. Our Discord and Telegram is a space where we actively listen to feedback and make adjustments based on suggestions. We recognize that each community member brings valuable skills, knowledge, and perspectives. By considering their feedback, we‚Äôre able to improve our project and see things from different angles.

**What advice would you give to new users or investors looking to get involved with Xelis?**

We encourage new users and investors to join our social media channels and actively participate in the community. If you have questions, ask them openly; either we or another community member will provide an answer. Everyone is welcome, and your participation helps us improve. The strength of our community lies in its numbers and engagement.

**How can the community contribute to the growth and success of Xelis?**

Community members can contribute by spreading the word about Xelis, providing feedback on our tools, and engaging with the project on social media and our community chats. Every bit of involvement helps strengthen the network and its ecosystem. We also routinely have bounties/paid opportunities to assist in the development of Xelis. In addition, all of Xelis is open source, so all may contribute freely on GitHub.


## Team Dynamics

**What do you value most in your team, and how do you foster a positive work environment?**

The most important thing I value in my team is the open exchange of ideas. Everyone is encouraged to share their thoughts, feedback, and suggestions. We avoid pressuring anyone and allow each team member to work at their own pace. This fosters a positive, collaborative environment where creativity can thrive.

**How do you handle differences in opinions within the team during the development process?**

Differences in opinion are rare because each team member is responsible for their own part of the project. We trust each other to make the right decisions. However, when disagreements do arise, we discuss the issue, understand each other‚Äôs points of view, and either vote on the best solution or defer to someone‚Äôs experience with a similar problem.


## Future Outlook

**What upcoming features or developments are you most excited about?**

The upcoming implementation of Smart Contracts on our testnet is a major milestone. We‚Äôre excited to push this forward and gather more feedback and testing from the community. Smart Contracts will unlock new possibilities for developers and users, enhancing the overall functionality of the Xelis network.


## Conclusion: The Pulse of Progress

# The Role of Privacy in Cryptocurrency: The Xelis Perspective

The evolution of cryptocurrency has been a transformative journey, reshaping our understanding of finance and decentralization. However, one key principle ‚Äî **privacy** ‚Äî has faced significant challenges and, at times, outright neglect. This article explores the critical role of privacy in cryptocurrency, why it has been misunderstood, and how **Xelis** provides a balanced solution by prioritizing confidentiality while addressing the concerns tied to full anonymity.

## The Importance of Privacy in Cryptocurrency

Privacy is a cornerstone of freedom in any society. It:

- Safeguards individuals from undue surveillance
- Protects financial autonomy
- Ensures sensitive information does not fall into the wrong hands

In cryptocurrency, privacy is even more crucial. Blockchain transparency can unintentionally expose users‚Äô financial data. Without sufficient privacy:

- Users are vulnerable to phishing attacks
- Risk of scams increases
- Threats of physical harm can arise

Despite these risks, privacy in crypto has often been misunderstood and unfairly stigmatized.

## Misconceptions About Privacy Projects

Privacy coins are often wrongly associated with criminal activity. Key points:

- **Misunderstanding of privacy**: Most users seek protection, not concealment.
- **Unfair comparisons**: Traditional financial systems don‚Äôt expose transaction data publicly.
- **Regulatory impact**: Delistings and reduced adoption due to perceived risks

This misunderstanding has created a demand for privacy tools that strike a balance between confidentiality and transparency.

## Xelis: Striking the Right Balance with Confidentiality

Xelis redefines privacy as **confidentiality**, aiming for selective, not absolute, anonymity.

- **Transaction amounts and wallet balances are hidden**
- **Addresses and transaction flows remain visible**
- **Mirrors traditional finance** with selective transparency

This unique approach:

- Helps maintain compliance
- Protects users from scams
- Avoids the stigma of full privacy coins

## Adoption and Real-World Implications

Xelis has gained traction among third-party platforms, including exchanges, thanks to its balanced model.

- Avoids the pitfalls of fully anonymous systems
- Aligns more closely with how confidentiality works in traditional finance

It protects users from:

- Phishing
- Identity theft
- Physical targeting

...by hiding only what needs to be hidden.

## Why Confidentiality Matters More Than Ever

As crypto matures, **confidentiality** will become increasingly important. Xelis proves:

- Privacy and compliance can coexist
- Confidentiality is not criminal ‚Äî it‚Äôs essential
- Selective privacy ensures both security and accountability

## Conclusion

Privacy in cryptocurrency is not just a feature ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **necessity**. Xelis offers a thoughtful approach:

- **Safeguards transaction data and balances**
- **Maintains address visibility**
- **Supports compliance while enhancing user protection**

Xelis sets a new standard by proving that **security and transparency can coexist**. It‚Äôs time to restore balance to the crypto space and prioritize the **confidentiality** that users deserve.

    title: 'Xelite Pulse | Balancing Privacy, Scalability, and Speed: The Trade-offs (Episode 14)',
    description: 'Xelis redefines blockchain scalability by integrating lightweight, efficient privacy mechanisms like homomorphic encryption and zkProofs directly into its blockDAG architecture, avoiding traditional privacy chain performance trade-offs.',
    content: `
## üîê Privacy vs. Scalability in Blockchain & BlockDAGs

Technologies like **Homomorphic Encryption** and **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkProofs)** offer strong privacy and confidentiality, but they introduce **computational overhead**. This added complexity affects the **scalability** of both Blockchains and BlockDAGs by slowing down transaction processing.

---

## üöß Why These Technologies Make Transactions Slower

### 1. üßÆ Homomorphic Encryption

Homomorphic encryption enables computation on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it. While powerful, it comes with major trade-offs:

- **High Computational Overhead**  
  Operations on encrypted data require significantly more resources than plaintext. For example, a simple addition or multiplication might take multiple encrypted rounds.

- **Complex Cryptographic Algorithms**  
  It depends on advanced, slow-to-execute mathematical structures.

- **Large Data Sizes**  
  Encrypted data includes many extra parameters, leading to higher **communication** and **storage costs**.  
  For example, in Xelis, one ciphertext requires:

  - \`32 bytes\` for the **commitment**  
  - \`32 bytes\` for the **receiver‚Äôs handle** (to decrypt the amount)  
  - \`32 bytes\` for the **sender‚Äôs handle** (same purpose)  

  > These extra components increase transaction verification time and network propagation delays.

---

### 2. üßæ Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkProofs)

zkProofs allow one party to prove a statement is true **without revealing the actual data**. However, they come with scalability limitations:

- **Proof Generation Time**  
  Requires intensive operations (e.g. elliptic curve math, polynomial commitments).

- **Proof Verification**  
  More demanding than verifying a simple digital signature.

- **Larger Transaction Payloads**  
  zkProofs must be included in each transaction, inflating their size.

  For instance, Xelis includes:

  - **Ciphertext validity proof** ‚Äî Ensures the receiver‚Äôs ciphertext is valid and wallet-safe.  
  - **Commitment equality proof** ‚Äî Verifies output commitments match all ciphertexts.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Impact on BlockDAG Scalability

BlockDAGs are built for **parallel processing** and higher throughput. However, privacy methods create challenges:

- **Concurrency Bottlenecks**  
  Cryptographic overhead limits nodes' ability to process transactions in parallel.

- **Increased Latency**  
  Time spent generating/verifying proofs slows transaction confirmation.

- **Higher Resource Requirements**  
  Nodes must handle concurrent, heavy cryptographic workloads‚Äîespecially challenging for those with limited resources.

---

## üîÑ Traditional vs. Privacy-Enhanced Chains

**Traditional Public Blockchains & BlockDAGs**:

- Use **digital signatures**‚Äîlightweight and fast to verify.
- Transactions are processed in **plaintext**‚Äîeasy to propagate and validate.
- Offer **speed and simplicity**, but at the cost of **user privacy**.

**Privacy-Enhanced Chains (e.g., Xelis)**:

- Include cryptographic layers for **privacy and confidentiality**.
- Must overcome **computational** and **storage challenges**.

---

## üß† What Does This Mean?

While privacy-preserving technologies offer robust protections, they **consume significant resources**. In a BlockDAG setting, this may:

- **Slow down** transaction processing  
- **Hinder** scalability  
- Force developers to choose between **privacy** and **performance**

This trade-off highlights the need to rethink the **blockchain trilemma**. For privacy-integrated systems, it evolves into a **Quadlemma**:

> **Security ‚Ä¢ Decentralization ‚Ä¢ Scalability ‚Ä¢ Privacy**

---

## üöÄ The Xelis Approach: Privacy Without Sacrificing Scalability

Xelis is designed **from the ground up** to balance **privacy** and **scalability**, avoiding the pitfalls of retrofitted privacy layers.

### üîß Key Innovations:

- **Lightweight cryptographic methods** ‚Äî Built-in privacy with minimal overhead  
- **Optimized proof generation & verification** ‚Äî Faster cryptographic processes  
- **Minimized transaction sizes** ‚Äî Reduces load on the network  
- **Batch verification** ‚Äî  
  Xelis verifies **all transactions at once**, drastically improving scalability:  
  > The **more transactions per batch**, the **less time per transaction**.

- **Concurrency-first architecture** ‚Äî Efficient parallel processing even with privacy features

---

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

Xelis breaks the traditional trade-off by offering **scalable privacy** within a BlockDAG architecture. It paves the way for networks that **don‚Äôt compromise confidentiality for speed**.

> üåê Xelis proves that privacy and performance can go hand in hand.

    title: 'The Case for Confidential Cryptocurrencies: Why I‚Äôm Walking Away from Public Chains',
    description: 'Opinion Article: After years of investment, observation, and reflection, I have decided that I will never own another public blockchain project. My focus will instead be exclusively on privacy and confidential blockchain projects.',

## Why I Will Never Own Another Public Blockchain Project  
**By Cyber Henry**

The advent of blockchain technology brought with it promises of **decentralization**, **transparency**, and **empowerment**. Yet, as the ecosystem has evolved, the cracks in the public blockchain model have become glaringly obvious.  

After years of investment, observation, and reflection, I have decided that I will **never own another public blockchain project**.  
My focus will instead be **exclusively on privacy and confidential blockchain projects**. Here‚Äôs why:

---

### üîç Transparency Without Privacy Is a Double-Edged Sword

Public blockchains like **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum** pride themselves on transparency ‚Äî every transaction is publicly recorded and accessible.  

While initially hailed as revolutionary, this level of transparency has become a **vulnerability**:

- Imagine your bank balance and every financial transaction you've ever made displayed on a billboard.
- Public blockchain explorers allow **anyone** ‚Äî competitors, regulators, or malicious actors ‚Äî to track funds and analyze financial behavior.
- This exposure has led to **real-world targeting** of individuals due to their visible crypto holdings.

> **Confidentiality is not just a preference ‚Äî it‚Äôs a necessity for personal and financial security.**

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è External Pressures Compromise Public Blockchains

Public blockchains are increasingly shaped by **regulatory pressures**, often at the expense of user autonomy:

- Regulatory demands may push networks to **sacrifice privacy for compliance**.
- Privacy-focused chains are **designed to resist** such pressures and ensure that **users retain control** over their data and actions.

> Privacy is a **resistance mechanism** to external coercion, preserving user sovereignty in a world of increasing surveillance.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Is the Cornerstone of Freedom

Without privacy, **financial freedom is meaningless**. Public blockchains could:

- Enable dystopian-level surveillance by governments and corporations.
- Suppress dissent and innovation through constant financial tracking.

Projects like **Xelis**, **Monero**, **Zano**, and **Zcash**:

- Prioritize confidentiality.
- Recognize privacy as a **fundamental human right**, not a tool for illicit use.
- Give individuals **control over their financial data**.

---

### üè¢ Businesses Need Confidentiality

For enterprises, public blockchains pose even greater risks:

- Exposure of **supply chains**, **transaction volumes**, and **client relationships**.
- Breaches of **confidentiality agreements** and **competitive strategies**.

Privacy-focused platforms offer:

- **Confidential smart contracts** that protect sensitive operations.
- Enterprise-ready privacy solutions necessary for **corporate adoption**.

---

### üß≠ The Ethical Implications of Privacy

Supporting privacy projects is an **ethical stance**, not just a technical or financial choice:

- In a world where **data = commodity**, privacy is a stand against **exploitation**.
- Public blockchains often **enable mass surveillance** unintentionally.
- Privacy projects **defend individual sovereignty** over their data.

They also empower:

- **Activists**
- **Journalists**
- **Citizens in oppressive regimes**

> Privacy protects the vulnerable ‚Äî it's a tool for **justice and equity**, not secrecy.

---

### üß† Governments and the Myth of ‚ÄúNothing to Hide‚Äù

Governments often push the narrative that "**only those with something to hide need privacy**." This is:

- **Flawed logic** ‚Äî people lock doors not to hide wrongdoing but to stay safe.
- A tactic to stigmatize privacy and **discourage resistance** to surveillance.

Privacy is:

- About **autonomy**, **dignity**, and **security**.
- A **universal need** in the face of data breaches, identity theft, and overreach.

> Privacy-focused blockchains reclaim this narrative and reaffirm that **privacy is freedom** ‚Äî not guilt.

---

### üöÄ The Road Ahead

The future of blockchain lies in **privacy and confidentiality**.  

- Public blockchains were a critical **stepping stone**, but they‚Äôve **failed to meet** the fundamental need for privacy.
- Privacy-first projects are building the infrastructure for a **secure, equitable digital economy**.

**As investors, we vote with our capital.**  
By supporting privacy-driven projects, we declare:

> "Transparency without confidentiality is unacceptable."

---

### üèÅ Final Thoughts

In the end, **privacy is about trust** ‚Äî the trust that your digital life is your own:

- It‚Äôs about giving individuals and businesses the **freedom to operate without fear**.
- That‚Äôs why I will **never own another public blockchain project**, and will only consider investing in **privacy and confidential blockchain solutions**.

    title: 'XELIS Hardfork/Network Upgrade 1.16.0 Post-Mortem Review',
    description: 'A deepdive into the recent hardfork/network upgrade 1.16.0 including post-mortem review.',
    content: `
## üîÑ Hard Fork Upgrade: Xelis v1.16.0

On **December 30, 2024**, the Xelis network underwent a significant upgrade requiring a **hard fork** to version 1.16.0. This release introduced major improvements across **security**, **scalability**, and **usability**.

The hard fork was driven by:
- A critical bug identified through our bug bounty program ü™≤
- Planned performance optimizations ‚öôÔ∏è
- The introduction of new features üöÄ

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Enhancements in Version 1.16.0

**1. zK Proof Improvement (Bug Bounty Identified)**
- Improved verification to ensure source commitment handles are built correctly (as done for receivers).
- Prevents account bricking and other potential exploits.

**2. ZK Proof Transcript Enhancements**
- Included source ciphertext in the transcript for better linkage to balance version.
- Enhanced Commitment Equality Proof by verifying randomness alignment with the sender‚Äôs public key.

**3. Fast Sync P2P Protocol Rework**
- Fixed issue where fast-synced nodes could get stuck during mining due to invalidated transactions.

**4. Multisig Wallet Support**
- Added support for **multi-signature wallets**, improving fund security for users and exchanges.
- Crucial for institutional adoption.

**5. Storage Serialization Order Rework**
- Streamlined storage code by introducing a **generic serialization method**.
- Reduces redundancy and improves maintainability.

**6. RPC API Changes**
- Improved developer experience with refinements and new functionality in the RPC interface.

**7. Updated P2P Key Exchange**
- Each daemon now generates a unique Diffie-Hellman (DH) keypair to prevent node fingerprinting.
- Encrypted peer communications using DH-derived shared secrets.
- Options added for handling mismatched peer keys: ignore, reject, or warn.

**8. Commit Point on Chain Sync**
- Introduced a **commit point mechanism** for safe chain reorganizations.
- Helps preserve the original chain during failed reorg attempts.

**9. Smart Contracts Testnet Release**
- Released first testnet version of **Xelis Smart Contracts** using XELIS-VM and **Silex language**.
- Enables decentralized app experimentation and deployment.

**10. Storage Optimization Fixes**
- Optimized storage conflict resolution for better performance on long chains.

**11. New Block Version Implementation**
- Updated transaction selection rules to avoid duplicate inclusion in the same DAG branch.
- Prevents potential chain split vulnerabilities.

**12. Balance and Ownership Proofs**
- Added new cryptographic proofs:
  - Users can prove balances or coin ownership without exposing private keys.
- Future auditing will allow for direct verification in the blockchain explorer.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced During Hard Fork

**Issue:**  
Mining pools and user nodes remained on the old chain, causing **temporary chain splits**.

**Resolution:**  
- Core team worked with mining pools to ensure all were properly synced.
- Fork was **successfully restarted within one hour**.
- Improved the chain rewind process to be **scalable and chain-size agnostic**.

**Root Cause:**  
- Hard fork worked flawlessly in local and private testnets.
- Mainnet had higher difficulty, leading to simultaneous block creation.
- Resulted in node freezes due to repeated reorg proposals.

**Additional Issues:**
- Miscommunication and short notice before upgrade.
- Timing during holiday season led to reduced operator availability.
- Lack of collaboration with mining pools prior to deployment.

---

### üîß Future Improvements

- **Advanced Notice** for mandatory network upgrades with set upgrade dates.
- **Extended Testing** across third-party environments.
- **Fixed Difficulty** introduced for future hard fork transitions.

---

### üí∏ Goodwill Compensation

To support affected miners and pools:
- **Financial compensation** was issued from the **development fund**.
- This rare act underlines Xelis‚Äô **commitment to a user-first and miner-friendly approach**.

---

### üìö Lessons Learned

**1. Comprehensive Pre-Deployment Testing**
- Expand test coverage to include external stakeholders, not just internal teams.

**2. Enhanced Communication with Stakeholders**
- Provide extended upgrade windows.
- Better notify miners, exchanges, and node operators in advance.

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

Despite challenges, the hard fork was quickly stabilized:
- **No long-term user impact**
- Thorough post-mortem showed **no exploitation** of bugs before patching

---

### üîÆ Future Plans & Upcoming Updates

Looking ahead, the team is focused on:

- ‚úÖ Smart Contract **Mainnet Launch**
- ‚úÖ **Consensus Algorithm Optimization**
- ‚úÖ Strengthening the **Bug Bounty Program**
  - Now includes formal **Third-Party Audits**

---

### üéâ Final Thoughts

The deployment of **Xelis v1.16.0** is a major milestone in the project‚Äôs evolution.  
Even with early challenges, the release has:

- Strengthened network integrity üîê  
- Improved system performance ‚ö°  
- Set the foundation for mass adoption üåç

The lessons learned ensure smoother upgrades ahead as Xelis continues pushing boundaries in privacy, performance, and decentralization.

    title: 'COMING SOON: Launching Confidential Tokens on XELIS, Privacy-Powered Tokens Made Simple',
    description: 'Dive into the world of confidential tokens on XELIS, where privacy meets simplicity.',
    content: `
üöÄ Why Tokens on XELIS Are a Big Deal

XELIS is revolutionizing digital assets by enabling the creation of **Layer 1 confidential tokens**, also called **"Confidential Assets"**, directly on its native **blockDAG architecture**.

Unlike traditional platforms that rely on smart contracts (e.g., ERC-20 on Ethereum), XELIS integrates token creation **directly into the consensus layer**, providing:

- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Wallet balances and transaction amounts remain **fully private**.
- **True Decentralization**: No centralized control or easy censorship like smart contract-based tokens.
- **Enhanced Security**: Eliminates smart contract vulnerabilities common on other platforms.
- **Censorship Resistance**: Native to the protocol‚Äîtokens can't be blacklisted or frozen by third parties.

> This empowers developers, dApp builders, meme coin creators, and financial platforms to issue **private, censorship-resistant tokens** that protect user financial privacy by default.

---

## üîí The Advantage of Layer 1 Confidential Assets Over Smart Contract Tokens

### Traditional Smart Contract Token Model (e.g., Ethereum, BSC)

- Tokens simulated through smart contracts (ERC-20, BEP-20).
- **Drawbacks**:
  - üõë **Increased Attack Surface** ‚Äî Frequent hacks and exploits.
  - üîê **Centralization Risks** ‚Äî Governance mechanisms often allow censorship.
  - üîé **Lack of Privacy** ‚Äî Public visibility into transaction history and wallet balances.

### XELIS Confidential Assets (Layer 1 Integration)

- Tokens created **natively** at the consensus level.
- **Benefits**:
  - ‚úÖ **No smart contract risks**
  - ‚úÖ **True censorship resistance**
  - ‚úÖ **Full privacy by default** via homomorphic encryption

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Easy Is It to Launch a Confidential Asset on XELIS?

XELIS is built for ease-of-use, offering multiple token deployment options to suit creators of all experience levels. A small **1 XEL fee** is required per asset to prevent spam.

### üñ±Ô∏è One-Click Deployment (In Development)

Coming soon via:
- Genesix Wallet
- Web-based tool

Steps:
1. Choose a token name
2. Set total supply
3. Configure minting/burning rules
4. Deploy via an intuitive graphical UI

> No technical experience required ‚Äî accessible for everyone.

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª Advanced Deployment Using Silex (Now on Testnet)

**Silex** is a Rust-adapted scripting language built for advanced smart contract and token deployment.

#### Example: Create a Token Called XELITE

\`\`\`rust
entry main() {
    let asset: Asset = asset_manager().create(0, "XELITE", 8u8, 100000000 * 8); // Create token
    transfer(transaction().source(), 100000000 * 8, asset.get_hash()); // Transfer to yourself
    return 0;
}
\`\`\`

#### Deployment Methods:
- Use the CLI wallet + API server
- Automate via Node.js
- Use Postman or any API tool

#### Example API Request:

\`\`\`json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "build_transaction",
    "id": 1,
    "params": {
        "deploy_contract": "000000000002000903203a20000400000000000000000001000000380200000201000100000000001a0101001a145400000114670000000202000102001455000001010200010000010100146a0001020001001000010000",
        "broadcast": true
    }
}
\`\`\`

> Whether you prefer point-and-click or code-based methods ‚Äî **XELIS makes launching tokens simple and powerful**.

---

## üßæ Summary: Benefits of Confidential Assets on XELIS

- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Privacy** ‚Äî Built-in encryption protects all transaction data.
- ‚úÖ **Decentralized & Secure** ‚Äî No third-party dependency or smart contract vulnerabilities.
- ‚úÖ **Versatile Use Cases** ‚Äî Perfect for DeFi, meme coins, and privacy-based utility tokens.

---

## üöÄ Ready to Launch?

We‚Äôre nearing the end of the **Smart Contract Testnet**, and the **Mainnet launch** for Confidential Assets is just around the corner.

**Are you ready to launch your confidential token on XELIS?**

    title: 'Xelite Pulse: How to Scale a Private/Confidential Blockchain? (Episode 22)',
    description: 'Dive into why Confidential Blockchains are more difficult to scale than Public Blockchains',
    content: `
When looking to scale a blockchain, one must consider whether the chain is **public or private**, as each type requires different optimizations. While both public and private chains aim to improve **transaction throughput** and **finality**, **privacy-focused chains** face unique challenges due to the computational complexity of cryptographic techniques such as **homomorphic encryption** and **zero-knowledge proofs (zkProofs)**.

---

## Public Blockchains

Public chains typically prioritize:

- **High transaction throughput**
- **Fast finality**

Many chains achieve this by increasing **blocks per second (BPS)**. Higher BPS leads to increased **transactions per second (TPS)**, which reduces congestion and ensures quicker confirmations for users.

---

## Privacy Chains (e.g., XELIS)

Privacy chains must:

- Prioritize **security and privacy**
- Simultaneously work toward **TPS improvements**

The primary challenge is **not block speed**, but the **computational overhead** of verifying **encrypted transactions**. Unlike public chains, where block speed is the main concern, privacy chains focus on optimizing **transaction verification time**.

---

## Key Challenges in Scaling Privacy Blockchains

### Homomorphic Encryption Impact

- **High Computational Overhead**  
  Processing encrypted transactions requires many arithmetic operations, significantly increasing processing time compared to plaintext transactions.

- **Complex Cryptographic Algorithms**  
  Advanced techniques introduce substantial computational costs, slowing down transaction validation.

- **Increased Data Size**  
  Encrypted transactions need extra data to ensure integrity and confidentiality. For example, in XELIS:

  1. 32 bytes for the **commitment**
  2. 32 bytes for the **receiver‚Äôs handle**
  3. 32 bytes for the **sender‚Äôs handle**

  These requirements increase both storage and transmission costs, slowing down the network.

---

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkProofs) Impact

- **Proof Generation Time**  
  zkProofs involve elliptic curve computations and polynomial commitments, making them slower to generate than traditional digital signatures.

- **Proof Verification Overhead**  
  zkProofs consume more computational resources to validate compared to standard transactions.

- **Larger Transaction Payloads**  
  zkProofs add extra data, increasing:

  - Processing time
  - Transmission load
  - Storage burden

  In XELIS, this includes:

  - **Ciphertext validity proof** ‚Äì ensures encrypted transactions are correctly formed.
  - **Commitment equality proof** ‚Äì verifies transaction outputs match their commitments.

---

## Solutions in XELIS for Scaling Privacy Chains

- **Parallel Processing**  
  Enables nodes to process multiple cryptographic proofs at once, reducing bottlenecks.

- **BlockDAG Architecture**  
  Allows concurrent block processing and inclusion in consensus without orphaning blocks.

---

## Conclusion

Scaling public blockchains focuses on increasing **TPS** and reducing **finality time** without compromising security. However, **privacy blockchains** must balance **confidentiality** with **performance**, ensuring cryptographic operations can run efficiently for scalable systems.

It's no longer just about faster blocks or tweaking the consensus mechanism.

**XELIS** achieves this balance by combining:

- Unique **parallel processing** for transaction validation
- A powerful **BlockDAG** structure

> During local testing at 15s block speeds, XELIS can process roughly **~2500 transactions per second**.

However, that is not the end of the story. Xelis is currently developing a multi-thread verification system to further improve TPS.

- **Current Stats:**  
  Xelis achieves around **2500 TPS** with single-threaded transaction execution. However, we're implementing a multi-threaded batching architecture to allow parallel transaction validation, significantly improving scalability.

  - **Early Results:**
    - 4 threads processing transactions in parallel.
    - 10,000 TXs verified in just **1.3084s**.
    - A **3x improvement** in throughput, reaching **7692 TPS** without increasing block size or block time.

**Keep a close eye on our social media and GitHub as we continue to develop this innovative solution to further the processing potential.**

#### 3. **Educational Content Creation**

[Medium Article: **Scaling Public vs. Privacy Blockchains: How Xelis Sets a New Standard**](https://xeliscommunity.org/xelite-pulse-how-to-scale-a-private-confidential-blockchain-episode-22-aaa0efe557fd)

Scaling a blockchain isn‚Äôt one-size-fits-all ‚Äî public and privacy-focused chains require different optimizations. While public blockchains focus on increasing TPS (transactions per second) and reducing finality time, privacy blockchains face additional cryptographic challenges.

Public chains improve scalability by increasing blocks per second (BPS), ensuring faster confirmations and lower congestion. However, privacy chains like Xelis must balance security and TPS, with the real bottleneck being transaction verification time due to:

Homomorphic encryption ‚Äî High computational overhead and complex cryptography.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkProofs) ‚Äî Increased proof generation time and larger transaction sizes.
Xelis addresses these challenges with:

Parallel Processing ‚Äî Nodes validate multiple cryptographic proofs simultaneously, reducing bottlenecks.
BlockDAG Architecture ‚Äî Multiple blocks process in parallel, preventing orphan blocks and increasing efficiency.
During tests, Xelis achieved approximately 2500 TPS at 15s block speeds, making it the most high-performance proof-of-work privacy chain to date.

Scaling public blockchains is mainly about increasing TPS and reducing finality time, but privacy blockchains require unique solutions. Xelis sets a new standard for confidential transactions by leveraging parallel processing and BlockDAG for both privacy and performance.

[Medium Article: **What is a confidential token?**](https://xeliscommunity.org/xelite-pulse-how-to-scale-a-private-confidential-blockchain-episode-22-aaa0efe557fd)

Xelis is revolutionizing the concept of digital assets by enabling the creation of Layer 1 Confidential Tokens (Confidential Assets) directly on our native BlockDAG architecture.

    title: 'Xelis Emissions Schedule',
    description: 'Xelis is a PoW project with a unique emissions schedule. Learn how Xelis rewards miners with its decreasing block rewards.',
    content: `
Xelis $XEL is a privacy, speed & scalability focused Layer 1 BlockDAG project. The Xelis network is secured through Proof-of-Work (POW) where miners utilize hardware to compete to provide ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù. Providing consensus ensures that the blockDAG is ordered correctly and only contains the honest transactions. For providing this service, miners are rewarded with Block Rewards of XELIS coins. It‚Äôs these block rewards which emit the total supply of Xelis on a daily basis (every 15 seconds to be exact).

In order to understand the supply of POW coins it becomes important to understand the block reward structure and what amount of reward will be paid to miners throughout a project‚Äôs lifecycle. Xelis has implemented a smooth emissions reduction strategy which forgoes any halving or sudden decreases in mining rewards. Instead, each block is incrementally decreased by just a fraction leading to a smooth reduction in the block-reward until the max supply of 18.4m is reached. Although very different from the methodology of BTCs halvings, the release follows a similar slope, duration and trend to BTCs emissions.

It is believed that this smooth emissions reduction prevents any unintended consequences of halvings, such as mining hashrate decreasing suddenly due to profitability, thus leading to an insecure network.

For more details on the exact emissions please consult our stats page at: https://stats.xelis.io/views/supply_emission

    title: 'Xelis vs. Leading Blockchains: A Comprehensive Cryptocurrency Comparison',
    description: 'Dive into an easy to understand comparison of Xelis compared to Bitcoin, Monero, Ethereum, and Kaspa.',
    content: `
# Comparison of Cryptocurrencies

The comparison chart in the provided document compares five cryptocurrencies: **XELIS**, **KASPA**, **MONERO**, **BITCOIN**, and **ETHEREUM**, across various attributes. 

## Blockchain Type: Blockchain vs. BlockDAG

**XELIS and KASPA:** Use BlockDAG.

**MONERO, BITCOIN, and ETHEREUM:** Use Blockchain.

### Blockchain:

- **Structure**: A linear sequence of blocks where each block contains a list of transactions. Each block is linked to the previous one via cryptographic hash, forming a single chain.
- **Confirmation Time**: Transactions need to be confirmed by adding them to a new block, which can lead to longer confirmation times as the chain grows.
- **Scalability**: Limited by the block size and block time, often leading to scalability issues as the number of transactions increases.
- **Security**: Highly secure due to the sequential and linear nature of the chain, making it difficult to alter previous blocks without re-mining all subsequent blocks.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Typically relies on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate transactions and add new blocks to the chain.
- **Examples**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero.

### BlockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph):

- **Structure**: A more complex structure where transactions are organized in a directed acyclic graph rather than a single chain. This allows multiple blocks to be created and confirmed simultaneously.
- **Confirmation Time**: Transactions can be confirmed more quickly since they do not need to wait for a single chain to extend. Multiple branches can process transactions concurrently.
- **Scalability**: Generally more scalable than traditional blockchains because it can handle a higher volume of transactions without congestion, leveraging parallelism.
- **Security**: Provides robust security but with a different approach. Instead of relying on a single chain of blocks, it uses a graph structure where transactions reference multiple predecessors, making it harder for attackers to rewrite history.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Uses mechanisms that can handle the non-linear structure, such as those enabling rapid and parallel block creation.
- **Examples**: IOTA, Fantom, KASPA, XELIS.

### Key Differences:

- **Structure**: Blockchain is linear; BlockDAG is a graph.
- **Confirmation Time**: Blockchain can be slower; BlockDAG is faster due to parallel processing.
- **Scalability**: Blockchain has inherent limits; BlockDAG is more scalable.
- **Security**: Both are secure, but BlockDAG uses different methods to ensure security across its graph structure.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Blockchain typically uses PoW or PoS; BlockDAG uses mechanisms suited for parallel validation.

In summary, while blockchains offer simplicity and strong security with a linear sequence of blocks, BlockDAGs provide enhanced scalability and faster transaction confirmation through a more complex graph structure that allows for parallel processing of transactions.

## Encryption vs. No Encryption in Blockchain

**XELIS:** Yes, on balances and transferred amounts.
**KASPA and BITCOIN:** No.
**MONERO:** Yes, on addresses, balances, and amounts.
**ETHEREUM:** No.

### Encryption in Blockchain:

- **Definition**: Encryption in blockchain involves using cryptographic algorithms to secure data, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the information.
- **Privacy**: Encrypts sensitive information such as transaction details, user identities, and balances, enhancing privacy.
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access and tampering with data. Even if the data is intercepted, it remains unreadable without the correct decryption key.
- **Anonymity**: Can offer higher levels of anonymity by obscuring user identities and transaction details.
- **Examples**: Monero employs encryption to provide enhanced privacy for transactions, making it difficult to trace the origin, destination, and amount involved in transactions.

### No Encryption in Blockchain:

- **Definition**: A blockchain with no encryption means that the data recorded on the blockchain is not obscured, and anyone with access to the blockchain can read the data.
- **Transparency**: Ensures that all transaction details are publicly accessible, providing complete transparency.
- **Auditability**: Facilitates easier auditing and verification of transactions since all data is openly available and can be scrutinized by anyone.
- **Performance**: May offer improved performance and reduced complexity, as encryption and decryption processes can be computationally intensive.
- **Examples**: Bitcoin does not use encryption for its transaction data, making all transaction details visible on the public ledger.

### Key Differences:

- **Privacy**:
  - Encryption: Ensures that transaction details and user identities are hidden, enhancing privacy.
  - No Encryption: Makes all transaction details public, reducing privacy.
  
- **Security**:
  - Encryption: Protects data from unauthorized access and tampering, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
  - No Encryption: Relies on the inherent security of the blockchain protocol to prevent tampering but does not obscure data.
  
- **Transparency**:
  - Encryption: Limits transparency to authorized parties, as encrypted data is not readily accessible to everyone.
  - No Encryption: Provides complete transparency, as all data is openly accessible.
  
- **Performance**:
  - Encryption: Can introduce additional computational overhead due to encryption and decryption processes.
  - No Encryption: Typically has better performance since there is no need for encryption-related computations.

### Use Cases:

- **Encryption**: Suitable for applications requiring high privacy and confidentiality, such as confidential financial transactions, private messaging, and sensitive data storage.
- **No Encryption**: Suitable for applications where transparency and public verification are crucial, such as public cryptocurrencies, supply chain tracking, and public records.

**Summary**: Encryption in blockchain enhances privacy and security by obscuring transaction details and user identities, making it suitable for applications requiring high confidentiality. On the other hand, blockchains without encryption prioritize transparency and public accessibility, making them ideal for applications where open access and verification are essential. The choice between using encryption or not depends on the specific requirements of the application and the desired balance between privacy, security, and transparency.

## Transactions per Second (TPS):

- **XELIS**: 2500
- **KASPA**: 400
- **MONERO**: 10‚Äì15
- **BITCOIN**: 7
- **ETHEREUM**: 15

### Definition:
Transactions per Second (TPS) is a metric used to measure the number of transactions a blockchain network can process in one second. It is a crucial indicator of a blockchain‚Äôs performance and scalability.

### Factors Influencing TPS:

- **Block Size**: Larger block sizes can hold more transactions, potentially increasing TPS.
- **Block Time**: The time it takes to create a new block. Shorter block times generally lead to higher TPS.

## Consensus Mechanism:

- **XELIS, KASPA, MONERO, BITCOIN**: Proof of Work (PoW)
- **ETHEREUM**: Proof of Stake (PoS)

### Proof of Work (PoW):
- **Definition**: PoW is a consensus mechanism where miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles.
- **Security**: High security, but energy-intensive.
- **Energy Consumption**: Very high due to computational power requirements.
- **Decentralization**: Can lead to centralization if mining is dominated by large pools.

### Proof of Stake (PoS):
- **Definition**: PoS is a consensus mechanism where validators are chosen based on their stake in the network.
- **Security**: Validators risk losing staked coins for malicious behavior.
- **Energy Consumption**: Much lower than PoW.
- **Decentralization**: Can lead to centralization due to wealth concentration.

## Mining Hardware:

- **XELIS**: Decentralized, GPUs & CPUs.
- **KASPA and BITCOIN**: Centralized, ASICs.
- **MONERO**: Decentralized, CPUs.
- **ETHEREUM**: No mining, centralized validators.

### GPU vs. CPU vs. ASIC for Decentralization:

1. **CPU**: 
   - Widely available and accessible, promoting decentralization.
   - Less efficient for mining.
2. **GPU**: 
   - Efficient and accessible, balances decentralization and performance.
   - Higher cost, with potential for centralization through large mining farms.
3. **ASIC**: 
   - Most efficient for mining but leads to centralization risks due to high costs.

### Conclusion: 
- **CPUs and GPUs** promote decentralization by making mining more accessible. **ASICs**, while efficient, tend to centralize mining power due to high costs.
  
## Native Smart Contracts & Virtual Machine:

- **XELIS**: Yes
- **MONERO**: No
- **KASPA & BITCOIN**: No, only data insertion
- **ETHEREUM**: Yes

### Native Smart Contracts vs. Data Insertion:

- **Native Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with conditions written into code. **Use Cases**: DeFi, DApps, legal agreements, etc.
- **Data Insertion**: Inserting data into the blockchain without execution logic. **Use Cases**: Proof of existence, asset registration, etc.

### Smart Contract Programming Language:
- **XELIS**: XELIS VM (Golang-like).
- **KASPA, MONERO, and BITCOIN**: No.
- **ETHEREUM**: Solidity.

A smart contract programming language is a specialized programming language designed for creating and executing smart contracts on blockchain platforms. These languages are tailored to define the rules and conditions of a contract in a manner that can be automatically enforced by the blockchain network. Examples of these languages include Solidity and Go (or XELIS VM). Each of these languages is tailored to the specific blockchain platform they support, providing varying levels of functionality, security features, and ease of use depending on the requirements and goals of the blockchain network.

### Scalable Technology:
- **XELIS and KASPA**: Yes, BlockDAG.
- **MONERO, BITCOIN, and ETHEREUM**: No.

BlockDAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) are considered more scalable than traditional blockchains primarily due to their inherent structure and how they handle transactions and consensus. Here are several reasons why BlockDAGs can offer better scalability:

1. **Parallel Transactions**: In a BlockDAG, transactions can be processed concurrently rather than sequentially as in a blockchain. This parallel processing capability allows for higher throughput of transactions, thereby increasing the overall scalability of the network.

2. **Reduced Confirmation Times**: Since transactions in a BlockDAG can reference multiple previous transactions (not limited to a single chain), confirmation times for transactions can be significantly reduced. This is because transactions can be confirmed as soon as they are indirectly referenced by subsequent transactions, rather than waiting for them to be included in a block.

3. **Flexibility in Consensus**: BlockDAGs often employ consensus mechanisms that are more flexible and adaptive compared to traditional blockchain consensus algorithms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). These mechanisms can allow for faster consensus on transactions and better handling of network forks or conflicts.

4. **Scalable Validation**: Validators in a BlockDAG can validate transactions independently and in parallel, as they are not constrained by a single linear chain. This parallel validation further enhances the scalability of the network by distributing the computational load.

5. **Resilience to Forks**: BlockDAGs can handle and resolve forks more efficiently than traditional blockchains. This resilience is due to the nature of the DAG structure, where conflicting transactions can coexist and be resolved through consensus mechanisms that consider the overall structure of the DAG rather than just the longest chain.

6. **Dynamic Structure**: BlockDAGs can dynamically adjust their structure and grow more organically compared to blockchains, which often have fixed block intervals and block sizes. This adaptability allows BlockDAG networks to better accommodate varying transaction volumes and network conditions.

Overall, the scalability of BlockDAGs arises from their ability to process transactions in parallel, reduce confirmation times, employ flexible consensus mechanisms, and handle network forks efficiently. These characteristics make BlockDAGs a promising alternative for applications requiring high transaction throughput and scalability compared to traditional blockchain architectures.

### Fair Launch (No Premine or Presale):
- **XELIS, KASPA, MONERO, and BITCOIN**: Yes.
- **ETHEREUM**: No.

In the context of cryptocurrencies, a "fair launch" refers to the initial distribution of tokens or coins in a transparent and equitable manner. The concept emerged as a response to concerns about fairness and decentralization within crypto projects, particularly in contrast to projects that might use strategies like pre-mining or pre-sale allocations to insiders.

**Key characteristics of a fair launch in crypto include**:

- **Equal Opportunity**: All participants have an equal chance to obtain tokens or coins at the beginning of the project. This typically means that tokens are not pre-mined (created before public availability) or disproportionately allocated to a small group before being made available to the wider public.
  
- **Transparency**: The process of token distribution is transparent and openly communicated to the community. Details such as token issuance schedule, allocation methods, and any associated costs or fees are clearly disclosed.
  
- **Community Involvement**: There is often a focus on community participation and engagement. This can include mechanisms such as bounties, tips, and grants.

- **Decentralization**: The project aims to maintain decentralization from the start, meaning that no single entity or small group has undue control over the network or token supply. This is often tied to distribution methods that disperse tokens widely among users and stakeholders.

Fair launches are often seen as a way to foster trust and confidence among the cryptocurrency community, as they align with principles of decentralization and inclusivity. They aim to prevent centralization of wealth and power within the project's ecosystem, promoting a more open and equitable distribution of coins.

### Project Funding Mechanism in Protocol:
- **XELIS**: Yes, miner fee.
- **KASPA, MONERO, and BITCOIN**: No.
- **ETHEREUM**: Yes, premine.

Project funding is crucial in cryptocurrency projects for several reasons:

- **Development and Innovation**: Funding allows cryptocurrency projects to allocate resources towards research, development, and innovation. This includes hiring talented developers, engineers, and researchers who can contribute to improving the technology, enhancing security, and developing new features.
  
- **Infrastructure and Operations**: Cryptocurrency projects require robust infrastructure to maintain network operations, node support, wallet services, and other essential components. Funding helps cover the costs of servers, bandwidth, and other operational expenses necessary to keep the network running smoothly.
  
- **Marketing and Adoption**: Effective marketing is essential for attracting users, investors, and developers to the project. Funding supports marketing campaigns, community engagement efforts, and educational initiatives aimed at promoting the project and increasing adoption.
  
- **Legal and Regulatory Compliance**: As the cryptocurrency space evolves, navigating legal and regulatory landscapes becomes increasingly complex. Funding helps projects hire legal experts and consultants to ensure compliance with local regulations and navigate legal challenges.
  
- **Security Audits and Reviews**: Security is paramount in the cryptocurrency industry due to the potential for financial loss and vulnerabilities. Projects use funding to conduct regular security audits, penetration testing, and code reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
  
- **Partnerships and Collaborations**: Building strategic partnerships with other projects, businesses, and organizations can enhance the ecosystem and provide new opportunities for growth and adoption. Funding supports efforts to establish and maintain these partnerships, fostering collaboration and integration within the broader crypto community.
  
- **Long-term Sustainability**: Sustainable funding ensures the longevity and stability of the project. It allows teams to plan for the future, weather market fluctuations, and continue innovating over the long term without being solely reliant on short-term market conditions.

Overall, project funding is essential for cryptocurrency projects to grow, innovate, and achieve their goals in a competitive and rapidly evolving industry. It provides the necessary resources to build robust technology, attract users and investors, navigate regulatory challenges, and establish a strong foundation for long-term success.

### Account Model vs. UTXO Model:
- **XELIS and ETHEREUM**: Account.
- **KASPA, MONERO, and BITCOIN**: UTXO.

The account model and UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model are two different approaches to managing transactions and balances within blockchain systems. Here‚Äôs a comparison between the two:

#### UTXO Model:

- **Concept**: In the UTXO model, each transaction creates one or more Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). These UTXOs represent portions of cryptocurrency that have been received but not yet spent.
  
- **Transaction Structure**: When a transaction is made, it consumes one or more UTXOs as inputs and creates new UTXOs as outputs. The sum of inputs must equal the sum of outputs, ensuring that no cryptocurrency is created or destroyed, only transferred.

- **Verification**: The UTXO model allows for straightforward verification of transactions because each UTXO can be individually verified against the blockchain to ensure it has not been spent previously.

- **Scalability**: UTXOs can be processed in parallel, which can enhance scalability in terms of transaction throughput. However, managing a large number of UTXOs can also present challenges in terms of storage and computational efficiency.

#### Account Model:

- **Concept**: In the account model, users have accounts with balances, similar to bank accounts. Transactions involve updating account balances rather than referencing specific inputs and outputs like UTXOs.
  
- **Transaction Structure**: Transactions deduct from the sender‚Äôs account balance and add to the recipient‚Äôs account balance. Unlike the UTXO model, there‚Äôs no need to explicitly track and consume specific inputs (UTXOs) to create outputs.

- **Verification**: While straightforward for balance updates, verifying transactions in the account model typically requires more complex state management, as the entire account state must be considered to verify balances and prevent double-spending.

- **Scalability**: The account model simplifies state management and reduces the number of transactions needed to perform certain operations.

The superiority of the account model over the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model in blockchain systems depends on the context and specific goals of the system. Both models have their strengths and are suitable for different applications and implementations within the blockchain ecosystem.

### Max Supply:
- **XELIS and MONERO**: 18.4 million.
- **KASPA**: 28700 million.
- **BITCOIN**: 21 million.
- **ETHEREUM**: No max supply.

In cryptocurrency, the ‚Äúmax supply‚Äù refers to the maximum number of coins that will ever be created for that particular cryptocurrency. This concept is fundamental because it defines the ultimate scarcity and availability of the cryptocurrency in the long term.

### Fair Emissions:
- **XELIS**: 28% mined in first 2 years.
- **KASPA**: 72% mined in first 2 years.
- **MONERO**: 65% mined in first 2 years.
- **BITCOIN**: 25% mined in first 2 years.
- **ETHEREUM**: No max supply.

The concept of longer mining emissions being perceived as fair in cryptocurrency often relates to how new coins or tokens are introduced into circulation over time. Longer mining emissions can promote gradual distribution, equal opportunity, network security, and stability in the market perception of a cryptocurrency.

    title: 'Xelis Funding Strategy: Miner Block Fee vs. Community Donations',
    description: 'Understand the Xelis project funding strategy and why a temporary miner block fee was chosen over other funding models such as premine, presale or community donations.',
    content: `
## Xelis Development Fee and Funding Model

XELIS is a community-driven project without corporate or organizational funding. To support its development and ensure continuous growth, we have implemented a decreasing development fee starting at **10% of the miner block reward**. These funds are vital for establishing a robust early ecosystem and are exclusively used for **network development, marketing, and exchange expenses**.

### Development Fee Schedule:
- **10%** from block \`0\` to \`3,249,999\` (approximately 1.5 years with BlockDAG).
- **5%** from block \`3,250,000\` until the project stabilizes across major facets of the ecosystem.

The purpose of the fee halving design, with a higher fee earlier in the project, was to:
- Prevent early-stage mining domination during the low-difficulty stages.
- Help avoid centralization and possible market manipulation.
- Allow substantial early funding while the project is undiscovered.

Currently, Xelis dev fees are managed by the **core developers**. Once smart contracts are fully integrated, fees will be managed through a **Smart Contract with multiple trustees**, enabling the creation of a **DAO** for trustless and simple management. The fees are **temporary** and will decrease or be eliminated once the network can sustain itself.

---

## Why was Miner Fee chosen over Community Donation Model?

A **miner tax fee** was chosen over community donations for its **sustainability**, **predictability**, and **equitable distribution**. It ensures a consistent income stream by **automatically collecting funds from the mining process**, aiding in better financial planning and stability. This aligns miners‚Äô incentives with **network security and development**, as they have a vested interest in the project‚Äôs success.

The miner tax fee **spreads the funding burden evenly**, reducing centralization risks.

In contrast, relying on **donations** is **unpredictable** and **dependent on market conditions**, leading to potential inconsistent funding and potential misalignment of interests. 

There is no doubt, donations can bring benefits by allowing **passionate community members** to contribute directly, fostering a sense of **ownership and engagement**.

Yet, this approach risks **over-reliance on a few large contributors**, which can lead to **disproportionate influence** over the project‚Äôs direction and **community fragmentation**.

---

### In summary:
A **miner tax fee** provides a more **reliable** and **fair approach**, supporting:
- Infrastructure
- Ongoing development
- Overall stability of the cryptocurrency ecosystem

    title: 'Xelis BlockDAG: Enhanced Privacy with Compliance',
    description: 'Xelis is a blockDAG that uses partial privacy encrypt transaction amounts & wallet balances, balancing privacy, scalability, and regulatory compliance.',
    content: `
# üîí Xelis Privacy and Cryptography Overview

**Xelis** is a blockDAG cryptocurrency that leverages advanced cryptographic techniques, including **homomorphic encryption with Twisted ElGamal over Ristretto points** on an elliptic Curve25519 (Edwards25519). 

This allows Xelis to achieve a balance between **privacy, scalability, and regulatory compliance**. Unlike fully private cryptocurrencies like Monero, Xelis employs **partial privacy** to provide sufficient anonymity while maintaining efficient transaction processing and compliance with regulatory standards. 

This approach ensures:
- Faster transaction speeds
- Lower costs
- Flexibility for users

Making it suitable for both **individual privacy needs** and **transparent business transactions**. Xelis positions itself as a robust and adaptable solution in the evolving landscape of digital assets.

---

## ü§î What is Twisted ElGamal over Ristretto Points?

**Twisted ElGamal over Ristretto points** is an encryption scheme that:
- Utilizes the ElGamal encryption method
- Optimizes performance with augmentations like Pedersen Commitments
- Uses Ristretto points to ensure secure and efficient elliptic curve operations

This combination results in a **robust cryptographic framework** providing strong security, efficiency, and improved privacy.

---

## üîë ElGamal Encryption
ElGamal is a **public-key cryptosystem** based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. It provides **semantic security**, meaning that observing the ciphertext reveals no information about the plaintext.

---

## üîÑ Twisted ElGamal
- A variation of ElGamal
- Incorporates **Pedersen Commitments**
- **Faster** encryption/decryption
- Fully compatible with **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** like **Bulletproofs**
- Reduces ciphertext size per transaction
- Lowers storage costs and network fees

---

## üìà What is Ristretto?
Ristretto creates a **prime-order group** from the Edwards25519 curve, avoiding small subgroup attacks and ensuring predictable operations.

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Ristretto:
- **Prime Order:** Simplifies cryptographic protocols and avoids complex subgroup checks
- **Simplified Implementation:** Reduces risk of elliptic curve implementation errors
- **Interoperability:** Provides a consistent, well-defined structure for cryptographic operations

---

## üîó Combining Twisted ElGamal and Ristretto Points
By using **Ristretto points**, Twisted ElGamal inherits:
- Enhanced security of a prime-order group
- Protection against small subgroup attacks
- Efficient arithmetic operations
- Improved encryption, decryption, and key generation performance

### üåê Result:
A strong privacy framework **ideal for applications requiring anonymity**.

---

## ‚ùì Why Does This All Matter?
Utilizing **Twisted ElGamal over Ristretto points**, Xelis ensures:
- **Maximum privacy**
- **Efficient proof verification**
- **Reduced data size**
- Lower costs and improved network speed

---

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why Partial Privacy Over Full Privacy?

**Partial privacy** offers several advantages compared to full encryption models like Monero:

### üìà Scalability and Performance:
- Full encryption (like Monero) is **resource-intensive** and increases transaction size
- Partial homomorphic encryption **reduces computational burden**
- Faster transactions with **lower fees**

### ‚öñÔ∏è Regulatory Compliance:
- Full privacy complicates AML, KYC, and MiCA compliance
- Partial privacy strikes a balance:
  - Protects sensitive information
  - Allows tracking inflows/outflows for fraud prevention
  - Keeps Xelis **exchange-friendly** and **regulatory-compliant**

### üßæ Auditability and Transparency:
- Some transparency is crucial for **auditing** and **public verification**
- Partial privacy maintains this balance while safeguarding sensitive data
- Builds **trust** with users and regulators

### üë®‚Äçüíª Usability:
- Full privacy complicates the user experience
- Partial encryption is **user-friendly**
- Easier for **non-technical users** to understand and operate

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Conclusion:
While **Monero-style full privacy** offers unmatched anonymity, it brings regulatory and usability challenges. 

**Xelis‚Äô partial privacy model** delivers:
- Strong privacy
- Regulatory flexibility
- Scalability
- User-friendliness

Perfect for those seeking **privacy and performance without sacrificing compliance or accessibility**.

    title: 'Why You Shouldn‚Äôt Blindly Trust Cryptocurrency Developers: Always Verify Their Activity on GitHub',
    description: 'The article emphasizes the importance of verifying cryptocurrency developers activity and contributions on GitHub to assess their credibility, commitment, and the projects security before trusting or investing.',

# üîé Don't Trust, Always Verify: The Importance of Checking Developers on GitHub

In the world of cryptocurrency, **trust is a precious commodity**, but it‚Äôs often in short supply. While developers play a crucial role in the success and security of cryptocurrency projects, it‚Äôs vital to approach them with a healthy dose of skepticism. The adage **‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust, but verify‚Äù** is especially relevant here. 

By taking the time to scrutinize a developer‚Äôs activity on **GitHub**, you can protect yourself from potential risks and make more informed decisions.

---

## ‚úÖ The Importance of Verification

### üîç Transparency vs. Obscurity
Cryptocurrency projects often tout **decentralization** and **transparency** as core principles, but these can be compromised if developers operate in secrecy. 

GitHub serves as a **public ledger**, allowing you to verify:
- If a developer is actively working on the project
- What kind of work they are doing
- If their contributions align with the project‚Äôs goals

---

### üõ† Code Quality and Security
The **quality of code** in a crypto project is paramount. Poorly written code can lead to vulnerabilities, hacks, or exploitation.

By examining a developer‚Äôs **commits on GitHub**, you can gauge:
- Coding practices
- Attention to detail
- Responsiveness to security issues

Frequent, thoughtful commits signal a developer serious about project success.

---

### ü§ù Community Engagement
A trustworthy developer:
- Actively participates in the community
- Interacts with contributors
- Handles issues and pull requests

Unresponsive or dismissive behavior might indicate **ulterior motives**.

---

### üìà Commit History Analysis
Commit history reveals the developer's level of involvement:
- **Regular, meaningful contributions** = Strong commitment
- **Infrequent, superficial commits** = Potential lack of engagement

---

## üö© Red Flags to Watch For
- **Sparse or Irregular Commits:** Sporadic activity or inconsequential changes
- **New GitHub Accounts:** Brand-new accounts with no verifiable history
- **Lack of Peer Review:** Avoiding pull requests or community discussions
- **No Forks or External Contributions:** Lack of outside scrutiny and collaboration

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Verification is Essential
The cryptocurrency space is rife with **scams, frauds, and poorly managed projects**. Relying solely on the reputation of developers is risky.

**Verifying GitHub contributions empowers you to:**
- Make informed decisions
- Protect your investments
- Promote accountability within the crypto ecosystem

---

## üÜö How to Compare Developers on GitHub?

### üìä Activity Level
- Number of commits = Developer activity
- Higher commit counts = Greater involvement

### üìÖ Consistency
- Frequent, steady commits = Ongoing engagement
- Sporadic commits = Possible disinterest or part-time involvement

### üåê Breadth of Contributions
- Contributions to multiple repositories show versatility and expertise

### ‚ö° Impact on the Project
- Small, frequent commits = Maintenance and incremental updates
- Larger commits = Major features or significant changes

### üë• Team Dynamics
- Not all team roles commit equally
- Reviewers and maintainers may contribute less in raw commits but still play critical roles

---

## üß† What Does GitHub Tell Us About the Xelis Development Team?

**Lead Developer:** Slixe

### üî® Technical Expertise
- Almost **10 years of GitHub history**, not just a newcomer to crypto and github.
- Focus on open-source blockchain and cryptocurrency development
- Proficient in **Rust, C++, Python, JavaScript**

### üìÅ Project Involvement
- Regular commits to multiple repositories
- Focused on **code improvements, bug fixes, and new features**
- Prior work on:
  - @dero-community
  - @deroproject
  - @rust-lang
  - @rustcrypto
  - @dalek-crypto
  - @zkcrypto
  - @spectre (competitor project)
  - @rusty-kaspa (competitor project)

### ‚è≥ Consistency
- **Highly active contributor**
- Regular updates, steady progress
- GitHub heatmap of commits shows strong dedication in **2023-2024**
![GitHub Heatmap](/uploads/blog/github2.png)
![GitHub Heatmap](/uploads/blog/github3.png)

### ü§ù Collaboration
- Engages in discussions, issues, and pull requests
- Demonstrates a team-player mentality and commitment to open-source health

---

## üìù Conclusion: Don't Trust, Always Verify
In cryptocurrency, **due diligence is essential**. Developers are the backbone of any project, but **blind trust** can be dangerous.

**Verify their work through GitHub** to:
- Ensure alignment with committed projects
- Confirm genuine developer involvement
- Protect yourself from scams and poorly managed ventures

üí° **Remember:** In crypto, your success and security **lie in your own hands**.

# The Risks of Public Ledger Transparency in Cryptocurrencies and the Case for Xelis

## Emma‚Äôs Story
Emma, a successful entrepreneur, walks into a local electronics store to purchase a new laptop. Eager to use her cryptocurrency holdings such as USDT, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Kaspa, she selects a sleek model and heads to the checkout lane. As she approaches the counter, she pulls out her smartphone to complete the payment using her cryptocurrency wallet.

Unbeknownst to Emma, the public ledger associated with the cryptocurrency she is using displays her wallet‚Äôs balance and recent transaction amounts in real-time. While she is busy confirming the payment amount on her phone, Jason, the person in line behind her, is silently monitoring the retailer's deposit address on his smartphone.

Jason, a seasoned fraudster, notices that Emma‚Äôs wallet contains a substantial amount of cryptocurrency. Seeing this as an opportunity, he follows Emma out of the store and to her house. As Emma gets out of her car to walk up to her house, Jason grabs Emma and forces her back into her car. He then demands that she gives him her private keys, or he will harm her and her family. Terrified, Emma complies with the requests of Jason and provides her private keys.

With access to her private key, Jason immediately drains Emma‚Äôs wallet of its substantial funds before law enforcement has even been notified. The once substantial cryptocurrency holdings she had are now gone, leaving her both financially and emotionally devastated.

While this hypothetical story seems extreme, it does illustrate the hidden dangers of public ledger transparency. While the blockchain offers transparency and immutability, it also exposes individuals to risks such as targeted fraud and theft when wallet balances and transaction amounts are visible to anyone. Emma‚Äôs case serves as a stark reminder of the need for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Xelis that protect users‚Äô financial information from prying eyes and malicious actors.

## The Risks of Public Ledgers

### 1. Exposure to Theft and Fraud
Public ledgers provide a complete view of wallet balances and transaction histories. This transparency can be a double-edged sword. Malicious actors can easily identify high-value wallets and target their owners with phishing scams, hacking attempts, or physical theft. Once a hacker knows that a wallet holds substantial assets, they may be motivated to employ sophisticated techniques to gain access.

### 2. Increased Risk of Social Engineering
The visibility of wallet balances can make individuals more susceptible to social engineering schemes. For example, fraudsters may exploit the information to trick individuals into revealing private keys or performing transactions under false pretenses. The more a fraudster knows about a target‚Äôs financial status, the more convincing their scam can be.

### 3. Privacy Concerns
In a world where privacy is increasingly under threat, the public nature of blockchain transactions can be unsettling. Wallet balances and transaction amounts are visible to anyone with access to the blockchain, which can compromise personal and financial privacy. This lack of confidentiality is particularly concerning for individuals who value their financial discretion.

### 4. Potential for Market Manipulation
Transparency can also lead to market manipulation. Large holders of cryptocurrencies, often referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù can have their transactions tracked and potentially manipulated by market players who seek to exploit their actions. This visibility can undermine market stability and fairness.

## Xelis: A Safer Alternative

In response to these concerns, innovative cryptocurrencies like Xelis are emerging with features designed to address the privacy shortcomings of traditional public ledgers. Xelis introduces a more secure and private approach to digital transactions by incorporating encryption mechanisms that safeguard wallet balances and transaction amounts.

### 1. Encrypted Wallet Balances
Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, Xelis encrypts wallet balances, ensuring that the public cannot see how much money an individual holds. This encryption protects users from being targeted based on their financial status and reduces the risk of theft and fraud.

### 2. Privacy-First Transactions
When using Xelis, the details of a transaction are not visible to the public or merchants. This means that while transactions are recorded and verified, the amount of money involved is not transparent to the public, with only the recipient being able to see the transferred amounts. This approach aligns more closely with traditional financial systems, where transaction amounts and balances of users' wallets, accounts, and credit cards are not publicly accessible.

### 3. Enhanced Security
By obscuring financial information, Xelis reduces the risk of social engineering and other forms of financial manipulation. The lack of publicly available data means that attackers have less information to exploit, thereby improving overall security for users.

### 4. Facilitating Adoption
The privacy features of Xelis make it a more viable option for use in everyday transactions. Individuals and businesses alike can engage in cryptocurrency transactions without exposing sensitive financial information, thus making Xelis a more practical and secure medium of exchange.

## Conclusion
The public ledger transparency inherent in many cryptocurrencies, while beneficial for transparency and accountability, introduces significant risks related to privacy, security, and potential fraud. The ability to view wallet balances and transaction details publicly can lead to increased exposure to theft, social engineering, and market manipulation.

Xelis addresses these issues by incorporating encryption to safeguard wallet balances and transaction amounts, making it a more secure and private alternative. By ensuring that financial details are not publicly disclosed, Xelis aligns more closely with traditional financial systems in terms of privacy and security, providing a safer platform for cryptocurrency transactions.

As the digital financial landscape continues to evolve, the adoption of regulatory-compliant, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Xelis will become increasingly important in mitigating the risks associated with public ledger transparency and ensuring the secure use of digital assets.

# Vision of Smart Contracts on XELIS

The XELIS ecosystem is designed to support Layer 1 private smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) & assets using its native utility coin, **XELIS**. This coin will facilitate all transactions and fees within the network, including payments for smart contract execution, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Key Features of XELIS:

- **Utility Coin**: XELIS will be used for transaction fees, smart contract operations, and dApp interactions, promoting an integrated and efficient economic model.
- **Future Smart Contract Implementation**: While Smart Contracts are not yet available on the XELIS mainnet, their upcoming integration to testnet is expected to enhance the platform‚Äôs functionality and give a test environment for developers to start building.
- **XELIS Virtual Machine (XVM)**: The XVM is a dedicated execution environment that will utilize bytecode-compiled logic similar to EVM. It supports a robust set of programming constructs, providing developers with a familiar and powerful programming environment. Unlike EVM, XVM already supports several built-in types (string, bool, integers variants, arrays, and structs), helping developers utilize them more efficiently. Smart Contract programs will be built using:
  - **Assembler** (raw bytecode instructions)
  - **Silex** (a traditional programming language interpreted from Rust)

By leveraging XELIS as a universal medium for transactions and contract execution, the ecosystem aims to ensure efficient processing and foster growth and sustainability in private and high-performance blockchain applications.

     # The Cryptocurrency Quadrilemma: Xelis' Approach to Decentralization, Security, Scalability, and Privacy

## Introduction
Cryptocurrencies have revolutionized the financial world, promising decentralized and permissionless financial transactions on a global scale. At the core of this promise lies blockchain technology, which enables cryptocurrencies to function without central authorities such as banks or governments. However, this promise comes with challenges, leading to fundamental trade-offs known as the **cryptocurrency trilemma**‚Äîa framework highlighting three conflicting goals: **decentralization, security, and scalability**.

In this essay, we explore the origins and implications of the trilemma and introduce a fourth pillar‚Äî**privacy**‚Äîevolving it into the **Quadrilemma**. We will also examine how **Xelis** seeks to solve these challenges comprehensively.

## The Cryptocurrency Trilemma
Popularized by **Vitalik Buterin**, the **cryptocurrency trilemma** presents three core properties that every blockchain seeks to optimize:
![Trilemma Diagram](/uploads/blog/quadlemma2.png)
- **Decentralization**: Ensuring no single entity controls the system.
- **Security**: Protecting against fraud, hacks, and manipulation.
- **Scalability**: Enabling efficient transaction processing at scale.

### Decentralization
Decentralization ensures that no single entity can manipulate or control the system, making it resistant to censorship and corruption. However, the more decentralized a blockchain is, the more complex consensus mechanisms become, potentially **slowing down transaction speeds**.

### Security
A secure blockchain is one where transactions are immutable and resistant to attacks. However, prioritizing security often requires high computational resources, which can **limit scalability**.

### Scalability
Scalability is the ability of a blockchain to handle a growing number of transactions. Achieving scalability often involves **sacrificing decentralization** or using faster consensus mechanisms that might be **less secure**.

## Introducing the Quadrilemma: Adding Privacy
While the trilemma offers a valuable framework, another crucial factor must be considered: **privacy**. Many cryptocurrency users are concerned with the transparency of blockchain transactions, leading to the evolution of the trilemma into a **Quadrilemma**.
![Trilemma Diagram](/uploads/blog/quadlemma3.png)
### Privacy
Privacy ensures that users can transact without exposing sensitive financial data. While blockchains like **Bitcoin** provide pseudonymity, they lack full privacy. Solutions like **Monero and Zcash** use **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** and **homomorphic encryption** to enhance privacy. However, privacy features often **increase computational overhead**, affecting scalability.

## The Quadrilemma and Xelis: A Comprehensive Solution
Xelis, a **Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency**, addresses the **Quadrilemma** by balancing **decentralization, security, scalability, and privacy**. Here‚Äôs how:

### 1. Decentralization in Xelis
Xelis employs an **ASIC-resistant PoW algorithm** to ensure mining remains accessible to **CPU and GPU miners**, preventing mining centralization. This maintains decentralization and **prevents domination by industrial mining farms**.

### 2. Security in Xelis
Xelis leverages **PoW consensus with a BlockDAG architecture** to enhance security while maintaining decentralization. **Homomorphic encryption** is integrated to protect transaction details, ensuring financial data remains private while keeping the system secure.

### 3. Scalability in Xelis
To improve scalability, Xelis implements a **BlockDAG architecture** and optimized transaction validation, allowing higher transaction throughput. Key scalability features include:

- **1.25MB block size** with **15-second block times**
- **Efficient transaction finality** without relying on **Layer-2 solutions**

### 4. Privacy in Xelis
Xelis integrates **homomorphic encryption** and **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** to balance privacy with compliance. **ElGamal encryption** ensures transaction amounts and wallet balances remain confidential while keeping sender and receiver addresses public.

## The Quadrilemma Solution: Xelis‚Äô Balanced Approach
Xelis successfully balances all four pillars of the **Quadrilemma**:

- **Decentralization**: ASIC-resistant PoW ensures distributed mining.
- **Security**: BlockDAG and cryptographic techniques safeguard transactions.
- **Scalability**: Efficient block sizes and fast confirmations optimize transaction throughput.
- **Privacy**: Built-in homomorphic encryption and ZKPs maintain confidentiality without sacrificing compliance.

## Conclusion
Xelis pioneers a new era of **balanced blockchain development**, proving that decentralization, security, scalability, and privacy **do not have to be mutually exclusive**. Unlike traditional blockchains that sacrifice one pillar to enhance another, Xelis ensures a **harmonized and sustainable** approach.

By addressing the **Quadrilemma**, Xelis **sets a new standard for next-generation cryptocurrencies**, offering users a truly decentralized, secure, scalable, and privacy-centric financial system.

    title: 'The Road to Testnet: Xelis Smart Contracts and VM Update',
    description: 'Discover the latest advancements in Xelis as we prepare for the Testnet launch of our Smart Contracts and Virtual Machine (VM). This article provides an in-depth look at the current status.',
    content: `
XELIS continues to progress forward in its Layer 1 blockDAG platform, expertly designed to support secure and scalable encrypted smart contracts and decentralized applications. By harnessing the power of its native utility coin, XELIS efficiently manages transaction fees and contract execution, providing a seamless and secure experience for decentralized operations.

### Key Features and Virtual Machine Advancements

The core of the XELIS ecosystem is the XELIS Virtual Machine (XVM), designed to execute smart contracts through a stack-based architecture. XVM offers support for various data types, including integers, strings, booleans, arrays, and structs, giving developers versatility in designing smart contracts.

XVM allows developers to write smart contracts using either low-level assembly or a higher-level syntax called Silex, a Rust-inspired language. This provides flexibility, catering to both low-level system developers and those who prefer more abstraction.

While this approach bears similarities to Ethereum‚Äôs EVM, which offers mnemonic assembly and high-level languages like Solidity, XVM differentiates through its higher level of abstraction for its assembly level which should make it easier for smart contract developers. As well as the potential for increased performance.

### Progress and Performance Updates

Recent development in the XELIS ecosystem has been centered on improving XVM‚Äôs performance and functionality. Key enhancements have been made to stack operations, including the introduction of mem::take, a Rust function that allows developers to efficiently retrieve and remove a value from a mutable reference by replacing it with a default value. This avoids the need to clone or copy data, leading to faster pop_stack execution and significantly boosting performance.

The development team is also evaluating the potential advantages of optimizing push_stack operations, although the improvement over standard vector operations is still under review.

While the Shunting Yard Algorithm has not yet been implemented, significant improvements have been made to its design. The updated algorithm, which handles operator precedence in mathematical expressions, is expected to improve non-recursive parsing, enhancing memory management and preventing stack overflows when executing complex smart contracts. Its integration will mark a major step forward in the VM‚Äôs functionality.

Additionally, the lead developer is focused on implementing all missing opcodes, optimizing the virtual machine, and cleaning up the existing codebase. There‚Äôs also consideration for reworking the entire system to use a class-based hierarchy instead of structs. This rework could enhance the modularity of the system, making it easier to develop more complex smart contracts and decentralized applications.

Optimizations such as eliminating unnecessary value cloning, improving instruction dispatch times through lookup tables, and better memory management in nested loops have already led to significant performance gains. For example, the prime number benchmark time has been reduced from 2.7 seconds to 750 milliseconds, highlighting the efficiency improvements achieved so far.

### Smart Contract Innovation and Dynamic Token Management

XELIS is advancing its smart contract architecture with plans to move from a struct-based system to a class-based hierarchy. This shift will allow for real inheritance, making contract design more modular and facilitating cross-contract interactions. This change will simplify the development of more complex decentralized applications, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and NFT platforms.

In addition, XELIS is working on implementing dynamic token management within smart contracts. This will enable contracts to generate and manage multiple tokens or NFTs within a single contract, giving developers greater flexibility and control over digital assets in decentralized financial applications.

### Collaboration and Community Involvement

The XELIS project greatly benefits from its active developer community. Contributions through GitHub and community discussions have played a key role in optimizing the XVM and shaping its future. The collaboration between the development team and the community ensures that XVM remains robust, secure, and capable of supporting a wide variety of decentralized applications.

### Conclusion: Innovation in Encrypted Smart Contracts

As XELIS advances towards integrating smart contracts into its testnet, the platform is on the verge of a groundbreaking impact on the blockchain ecosystem. With its emphasis on encryption, security, and high-performance capabilities, the XELIS Virtual Machine (XVM) offers developers a robust and adaptable framework for crafting secure and scalable decentralized applications.

Continuous enhancements to its architecture, including advancements in stack handling, memory management, and cryptographic security, position XELIS at the cutting edge of blockchain innovation.

**As smart contracts come to life on XELIS, the ecosystem will unlock unprecedented opportunities for developers and users to create and engage with secure, and decentralized applications that set a new standard for the industry.**

# XELIS Whitepaper Release: A Milestone in Decentralized Technology

  Today marks a milestone in the development of decentralized technology with the release of the XELIS whitepaper, **‚ÄúXELIS: A High-Performance BlockDAG for Private, Instant, and Scalable Decentralized Transactions and Applications.‚Äù** This comprehensive document is the foundation for XELIS, a next-generation blockchain platform uniquely designed to empower decentralized applications and private, instant, and scalable transactions. You can read the full whitepaper here: [XELIS Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.xelis.io).

  ## Addressing the Limitations of Traditional Blockchain

  Blockchain technology has made revolutionary strides in digital asset ownership, privacy, and decentralization. However, these advancements have exposed significant limitations in the traditional blockchain architecture, particularly around scalability, speed, and privacy. As networks grow and transaction volumes increase, issues like congestion, high fees, and long confirmation times become challenging.

  ## The BlockDAG Solution

  To overcome these limitations, the XELIS platform leverages a **BlockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) architecture**. Unlike traditional blockchains that arrange transactions linearly, a BlockDAG allows for multiple blocks to be added simultaneously. This innovation fundamentally enhances throughput and network efficiency, making XELIS capable of supporting a much larger volume of decentralized applications and real-time transactions.

  In addition to efficiency gains, the BlockDAG architecture allows XELIS to process a high volume of transactions almost **instantaneously**‚Äîa game-changer for applications requiring near-instant confirmation.

  ## The Privacy Solution

  Privacy is increasingly a focal point in decentralized networks, as users demand stronger safeguards for their data. XELIS recognizes this need and implements a targeted privacy solution utilizing **homomorphic encryption**. Rather than encrypting all transaction details, XELIS specifically focuses on transaction amounts and account balances. This ensures that while these data remain confidential, other transaction metadata needed for validation and consensus can still be verified by the network.

  ### Homomorphic Encryption on Transaction Amounts and Balances

  By applying **homomorphic encryption** solely to transaction amounts and balances, XELIS achieves a balance between **privacy and performance**. Users' financial information stays private, and encrypted values can be computed within the encrypted domain without revealing exact figures. This ensures validation without compromising transparency and decentralization.

  ## Key Innovations in XELIS

  - **High-Performance Transactions:** The BlockDAG model enables parallel block creation, maximizing network speed without sacrificing security.
  - **Enhanced Privacy and Security:** Advanced cryptographic techniques ensure transaction data and wallet balances remain private.
  - **Scalable Infrastructure for dApps:** Built to support scalability without degrading network performance.
  - **Decentralized Consensus Mechanism:** A CPU/GPU Proof of Work mechanism ensures decentralization and security.

  ## The Broader Vision of XELIS

  The release of the XELIS whitepaper is more than just a technical document‚Äîit‚Äôs a blueprint for a transformative digital ecosystem. **XELIS envisions a future where decentralized applications are not limited by performance bottlenecks or privacy concerns.**

  In addition to revolutionizing decentralized finance (DeFi), XELIS opens the door for a new generation of decentralized applications and use cases that were previously out of reach.

  ## Join Us on the Journey

  We‚Äôre excited to share this whitepaper with the community and invite all developers, researchers, and blockchain enthusiasts to review our manuscript, provide feedback, and engage in the conversation about the future of decentralized technology.

    title: 'Feature Deep Dive: XELIS ‚Äî Balance Proofs & Ownership Proofs',

 # XELIS Introduces Balance Proofs and Ownership Proofs

The XELIS project recently introduced **Balance Proofs** and **Ownership Proofs** as part of its network upgrade, adding a system for securely disclosing wallet balances in a selective, verifiable manner. These features allow users to temporarily share the value of an encrypted balance or prove ownership of a minimum amount of assets without compromising long-term privacy. The proofs are designed to become invalid when the balance changes, maintaining privacy while enabling controlled transparency.

## Background: XELIS Before Balance Proofs

Prior to the addition of Balance and Ownership Proofs, XELIS operated with strict privacy measures, ensuring that all user balances and transaction data were fully encrypted and private. This encryption meant that no one, not even the development team, could verify wallet balances or trace transactions without the user‚Äôs explicit consent. While this absolute privacy was beneficial for security, it also limited balance verification for purposes like auditing or regulatory compliance. 

## Balance Proofs in XELIS

**Balance Proofs** allow users to create a one-time proof of their exact balance, valid only for the current state of the wallet. The Balance Proof becomes invalid once any transaction is made, ensuring that shared information does not expose ongoing transaction data. Using **Pedersen Commitments** and **Commitment Equality Proofs**, Balance Proofs verify the balance without revealing any transaction details, leveraging zero-knowledge principles to confirm the balance‚Äôs validity.

The technical process behind Balance Proofs involves creating a new ciphertext with the entire balance in the wallet, ensuring cryptographic consistency. A commitment equality proof is then generated to show that this ‚Äúzero‚Äù balance ciphertext indeed represents zero, without leaking other details. This proof structure maintains the privacy of the wallet while allowing for verifiable disclosures. 

Through the future **Human Readable Proof** format, which uses the **Bech32 encoding** like wallet addresses, users will be able to share proofs securely and easily with third parties (including applications and services).

## Ownership Proofs in XELIS

**Ownership Proofs** enable users to prove that they own at least a specified amount, named **N**, of a given asset, without disclosing the full balance. Users can configure N to any value above 0, providing flexibility for cases where they need to demonstrate minimum holdings rather than an exact balance. Ownership Proofs are particularly useful in scenarios where a user needs to show sufficient funds to engage in a transaction or meet a financial threshold without disclosing the entire balance.

Ownership Proofs use similar cryptographic principles as Balance Proofs, including **Pedersen Commitments** and **zero-knowledge proof methods**. The process ensures that only the necessary information (the fact that the user holds at least **N** units of an asset) is shared, while all other balance details remain encrypted and private. Additionally, Ownership Proofs expire once the wallet‚Äôs balance is updated, maintaining data integrity and privacy by preventing reuse or unauthorized sharing of outdated information.

## Potential Applications and Regulatory Implications

### Balance Proofs
By introducing Balance Proofs, XELIS has opened the door to **selective transparency**. This feature can aid in addressing regulatory requirements, such as one-time audits or balance verifications, allowing institutions or regulatory bodies to confirm wallet balances without needing access to private keys or continuous transaction histories. This aligns with compliance standards, including **anti-money laundering (AML)** and **Know Your Customer (KYC)**, providing a controlled and privacy-preserving solution for temporary visibility.

### Ownership Proofs
Ownership Proofs offer additional compliance capabilities by enabling users to demonstrate **minimum holdings** without revealing their full balance. This is ideal for scenarios where users must prove that they meet financial requirements or minimum holdings for eligibility in transactions, investments, or other financial interactions. 

For XELIS, this feature enhances the network‚Äôs utility by allowing verifiable, minimal disclosures that maintain high privacy levels, fulfilling potential regulatory demands while safeguarding user anonymity.

## Conclusion

With **Balance and Ownership Proofs**, XELIS has introduced a robust framework for selective, verifiable balance disclosures. These features enable users and the development team to provide transparency while preserving privacy. By combining **zero-knowledge proofs** with **flexible encoding methods**, XELIS supports one-time verifications for regulatory needs and transaction eligibility. This balance of transparency and privacy strengthens XELIS‚Äôs commitment to **user-focused privacy and compliance**.
